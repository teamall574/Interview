1 - what is IAAS

>>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a service. the cloud provider provides the Infrastructure to the developers
like network, storage, virtualization,servers can managed by cloud provider
>>this not physical things.it will provide only infrastructure. like vms,compute,memory,OS,network,storage,firewall. things you have full control on virtual machines
ex:- Virtual machines 

>>users are managed by operating system and middle ware, runtime data application all are managed by developers
>>by using IAAS to develop the application is very hard by compared to PAAS
Advantages:-
1-controling is high because you controlled
2-cost saving
3-scalibility. 
4-faster time to market
5-expand as you grow
6-tight security
7-anytime any where access
Disadvantages:-
1-no internet no work
2-privacy is limited
3-virtualization depend

2 - what PAAS
 
>>this not physical things.the PAAS will give platform for your application. for example you have an appliation or java or dot net application
there is no database person in your team you can ask the cloud service provide he will give the database and mantainance. things you dont have full control 
on virtual machines
>>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and 
operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.

>>the disadvantage you can't customize the things in you can't troubleshoot and changes you can trade-off or compromise. you can customize but limited things only
ex:- Azure sql and App-service it is managed by the Azure you can't control anything
  
3 - what is SAAS

>>this not physical things. it is readmade product. like office 365 or google apps or salesforce .it will give full software service. its controling on you 
it is very limited 
>>SAAS is pre-existed application that applications are accessible through internet connection and web-browsers 
like google chrome, gmail, mozila browser, salesforce

4-what is cloud-computing

>>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers,
you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

5-what is Total upfront,Partial upfront

>>Upfront:-your paying bill first then he will give some discount 
>>Partial upfront:- you can pay 50% of bill and then you can use remaing amount will pay after the month end bill generation time
>>No Upfront:- this is on-demand systems

6-what is 1-tier application

>>In 1-tier architecture, the data is directly provided to the user and that user can directly use the database through the computer. Any changes or updates that are done will reflect 
directly to the database

7-what is 2-tier application

>>Two-tier architecture. In a two-tier architecture, the client is on the first tier. The database server and web application server reside on the same server machine, which is the second tier.
This second tier serves the data and executes the business logic for the web application.

8-can you explain 3tier architecture or elbrate them

>>first we have extranal load balancer and internal load balancer then the extranal load balancer is open to the internet
through route53 and internal load balancer is between app and web and the app is connected to database

>>using public and private subnets

9-what is Front-end 

>>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—the part users see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using 
web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app
HTML,CSS, javascript, angular, react-js, Boot-strap, vue-js, Django, Swift, nodejs
port number 80 or 443
>>you will see the visual of application

10-what is backend

>>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing 
on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
java, python, .net, PHP, Nodejs,Go, C#
port number is 8080 or anything
>>java .net python  working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website

11-what is database

>>Databases often store information about people, such as customers or users. For example, social media platforms use databases to store user information, such as names, email addresses 
and user behavior. The data is used to recommend content to users and improve the user experience
mysql, RDS, Nosql, mongoDB, Oracle, PostgresSQl 
port number is 3306 or any other port 

12-how would you know which library is using in code

>>we run before packing the application we can run unit testing and compile the code using maven tool
>>we dont know which librarys using so that why we combine source code + librarys create into war or jar file
>>we can check the pom.xml all the librays and it contains information about the project and configuration details plugins goals and versions we can check only pom.xml
the build toolis 
java: maven
Dotnet: MSBuild
node js: NPM
python: no need to use build tool in python it is not inter-preted language. it will automaticaly install required packages using pip module

13-what is library

>>without library application will not work. library is nothig but its 3rd party application we will use the librarys to make up or development the application is more easy

14-what is this

>>if my project is java i will take maven as build tool
>>if my project is Android i will take graddle as build tool
>> Weservers are nginx, apache2,Caddy,monkey http server which will directly take the traffic which direcly rout to app servers
apache2 -->in ubuntu 80 port
httpd    -->in RHEL 80 port
nginx  -->80 port
>>app servers is an tomcat,JBoss,WildFly,Oracle weblogic
tomcat  -->8080 port 

jenkins   -->8080
sonarqube   -->9000
jfrog    -->8081
Nexus    -->8081

15-How many ways to Access the AWS

>>By using management console
>>access_kay and secret_key
>>AWS SDKs(software development Kits): using python boto3
>>AWS SSO(single sign-on) using anji@wipro.com
>>AWS Federation like SAML or Okta
>>AWS STS(Security token Service)

16-your unable to SSH into a linux server what steps would you take to troubleshooot this

>>check if the server is running and network accessible 
>>you can use the oing command to see if the serevr is reachable
>>check if the SSH port is open or not
>>check the firewall rules
>>check ssh configuration

17-how much time would take while launching installing

linux: minimum 3 minutes maximum 4 minutes (its requires minumum 8gb storage)
windows: minimum 4 minutes maximum 5 minutes (its requires minimum 30 gb storage)

18-Can we recover the EC2 instance when we have lost the key?

>>Yes, it is possible to recover an EC2 instance when you have lost the key. You can create a new key pair and then use it to connect to the instance.
Alternatively, you can also use other authentication methods such as user name and password, or even IAM roles to access the instance.
However, if you have encrypted the root volume of the instance using the lost key pair, you will not be able to recover the data on that volume.

19-how to restore the login into ec2 if pem file lost

>>Use a backup or a copy of the original .pem file:

If you have a backup or a copy of the original .pem file stored securely, you can use it to regain access to the EC2 instance.
Locate the backup or copy of the .pem file and follow the standard procedure to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key.

>>Launch a new EC2 instance and attach the original volume:

Launch a new EC2 instance and make sure to select the same availability zone and the same or compatible Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as the original instance.
During the instance launch, you can create a new key pair or choose an existing key pair to associate with the new instance.
Once the new instance is running, stop it and detach its root volume.
Detach the root volume from the original EC2 instance (the one for which you lost the .pem file).
Attach the original volume as a data volume to the new instance.
Start the new instance and access it using the new key pair. You can then mount the original volume and retrieve any necessary files.

>>Use EC2 Instance Connect or Session Manager:

If you have EC2 Instance Connect or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager set up on the EC2 instance, you may be able to regain access without the need for the .pem file.
EC2 Instance Connect allows you to connect to your EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI without a key pair. Check if EC2 Instance Connect is enabled for your
instance and follow the instructions provided by AWS. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager allows you to establish a secure shell (SSH) session to your instance through the AWS Management 
Console or the AWS CLI. If Session Manager is enabled for your instance, you can connect to it without needing the .pem file.

20-How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime?

>>To upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime, you can use the following steps:
1-Set up a load balancer in front of your system.
2-Deploy the new version of your system to a new set of servers.
3-Add the new servers to the load balancer and verify that they are healthy.
4-Remove the old servers from the load balancer.
5-Monitor the system to ensure that everything is running smoothly.
By following this process, you can ensure that your system remains available throughout the upgrade or downgrade process.

21-How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime?

>>You can upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime using the following steps of migration:

Open EC2 console
Choose Operating System AMI
Launch an instance with the new instance type
Install all the updates
Install applications
Test the instance to see if it’s working
If working, deploy the new instance and replace the older instance
Once it’s deployed, you can upgrade or downgrade the system with near-zero downtime.

22-what is the secret_key and access_key

>>Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. 
If you don't have access keys, you can create them by using the IAM console

>>AWS access key ID is a form of unique user/account identifier. AWS secret key is like private key. When AWS CLI sends a API request, 
the payload is signed by generating an HMAC with the secret key as the key

23-Is node.js will supoort backend and frontend

>>yes node.js will support frontend and backend also
3 tier arch
database:- MongoDB or Postgres or MySQL
frontend-web-application:- nodejs (webapp)
backend-end-application:-  nodejs (app-servers) or java

24-what is virtualization

>>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, 
storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs)

25-What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?

>>Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separately from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record 
in the root block device of your image.
>>Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
>>Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.

26-Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific

>>AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront

27-Define and explain the three basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them?

--The three basic types of cloud services are:

>>Computing: - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsail.
>>Storage - These include S3-simple service storage, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.
>>Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53

28-what is VPC

>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. 

>>it is a region dependent
>>Vpc is a logical boundary
>>vpc id is globally unique
>>you can stop the particular ip one ec2 to another ip through routing table in peering

29-what is Subnet

>>A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You launch AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your subnets. You can connect a subnet to the internet, other VPCs,
and your own data centers, and route traffic to and from your subnets using route tables.

30-what is Route tables in AWS

>>A Route table defines how the communication should happen with in the subnet and outside of subnet
>>we can create custom route tables per each subnet design the network traffic
>>route table play key role when you want route traffic to 
-other vnets
-virtual network gateways
-virtual appliances
-internet
>>it is also subnet level

31-What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

>>AWS regions are separate geographical areas, like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai). On the other hand, availability zones
are the areas that are present inside the regions. These are generally isolated zones that can replicate themselves whenever required.
>>The AWS Cloud spans 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions
>>20 per Region you can request need more
>>ou can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a 
maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.

32-what is nat-gateway

>>A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. it is used in private system to connect over the internet to take patches or update 
nat gateway is intellignet device using source destination packets. it will send only traffic through the public instance but not allow outside the 
traffic to your private instances.when you enabling nat gateway you must select the public subnet not the private subnet
 
33 - what is NAT-Instance

>>NAT-A NAT (Network Address Translation) instance is, like same nat-instance gateway but the differnce is the amount is big is nat gateway when compared
to nat instance

34 - What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?
 
NAT-Gateway
1 - nat gateway managed by aws 
2 - nat gateway canot assigned security groups
3 - nat gateway highly availble
4 - nat gateway bandwidth is upto 45 mbps
5 - nat gateway perfomance is good

NAT-Instance
1 - nat instance managed by you
2 - nat instance can assignes security groups
3 - nat instance is also highly availble
4 - nat instance bandwidth is depends on instnace bandwidth
5 - nat instance performance compared to nat gateway is average

35-what is Vpc End-point

>>A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services. instance in your vpc do not require public ip
address to communicate the aws resources
>>S3
>>DynmoDB
>>Also create Interfaces like EkS,Auto-Scaling,Cloud-Trail,Cloud-formation

36-what is gateway 

>>A gateway refers to a network component that acts as an entry or exit point for traffic entering or leaving a cloud environment. It serves as a bridge between different networks or 
systems and enables communication and data transfer between them. Gateways can be used for various purposes, such as security, monitoring, load balancing, and routing. Examples of 
cloud gateways include API gateways, database gateways, and messaging gateways.

gateawy is hardware device that gives you entry and exit point in your network
>>gateway end-point is a gateway that you specific as a target for a route in your table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service

37-what is VPC Perrring

>>A VPC peering  is a networking connection between two VPCs or two differnet networks. that enables you to route traffic between 
two differnt networks or two vpcs. once perring comleted they can communicate each other as if they are within the same network

>>there is no charges in vpc perring
>>you can also create the vpc peering one region mumbai to another region ohio like this
>>you can also vpc peering one account to another account

===disadvantages of peering

>>increase in the vpc will increase in the vpc peerings
>>each vpc needs a vpg for vpn connections

38-What is a transit gateway?

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring, in vpc perring if we created 3 or more vpc we need interconnect using vpc perring if we increase vpc perring its
diffcult to identify the traffic and get confused invpc perring. so that we using transit gateway we create one transit gateway we can interconnect the
vpc in a region its easy to understand easy to use. we can interconnect differnt region also easy way. but it is chargble

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring. the transit gateway simplifies your network connection and puts an end to complex peering relationships.
Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud router—each new connection is made only once

39-what is NACL

>>A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

>>when you created vpc automatically create nacl 
>>if anyone want say to change something nacl first ask send a mail 
>>don't do changes in nacl in production environment
>>need to add every rule in inbound and outbound  -->if you add ssh in inbound it will not allow so you need to add outbound also

40-what is security group is stateful or stateless in aws

>>Security groups are stateful—if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of 
inbound security group rules. For VPC security groups, this also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of 
outbound rules.

41-What is the difference between security group and NACL?

>>Security Group is applied to an instance only when you specify a security group while launching an instance.NACL has applied automatically to all
the instances which are associated with an instance. is the second layer of defense.
>>by default in security group there no deny option it will allow the traffic how you will deny the ip . in that place you can allow specific ip only
>>security-group is stateful
>>if you use security group it will be only server level only. security group only have allow the ips only

>>NACL It is the first layer of defense.
>>NACL only for subnets by default automatically creates a VPC when we create a VPC and NCL is Stateless you need to enable inbound and outbound also if you are enable inbound not 
enabled outboind it will not work and it will sit infornt of security group 
>>if you add one port in the inbound rule you need to add an ephemeral port in the outbound otherwise it won't work
>>it will applied by subnet any server is there in subnet this will apply to that server or subnet level  using NACL.NACL have allow and deny option

42-How many security groups can be attached to an EC2 instance?

>>five

43-where we can attach security groups

>>EC2
>>Load-Balancer  (all)
>>Not for subnets

44-What is the difference between NACL and Subnet ? Explain with a use case ?

>>For example, I want to design a security architecture, I would use a combination of NACLs and security groups. At the subnet level, I would configure NACLs to enforce inbound and
outbound traffic restrictions based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. NACLs are stateless and can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering traffic 
at the subnet boundary.At the instance level, I would leverage security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups are stateful and operate at the instance level. 
By carefully defining security group rules, I can allow or deny specific traffic to and from the instances based on the application's security requirements.By combining NACLs and 
security groups, I can achieve granular security controls at both the network and instance level, providing defense-in-depth for the sensitive application.

45- What is Amazon EC2?

>>Ec2 Means elastic cloud computing where you are requesting AWS the cloud provider to give a virtual machine or virtual server which is elastic in nature this term is called 
compute that we called EC2
>> Elastic is nothing but scaled up and scaled-down any time is called elastic
ex:-Elastic cloud compute, elastic beanstalk, EKS, ECR , ECS
                                                     (or)
>>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web-based service that allows businesses to run application programs in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud.
>>Amazon Ec2 is scalble computing capacity and you can use the images to you cn launch the servers as you need. and its configure security and networking and storage
amazone ec2 helps you to scale up and down handling the requirements

46-what is AMI In AWS

>>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured image using this images to launch the virtual servers
>>AMI id is different of every region and every image
>>you can use in production mostly use already created AMIs

47-you are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

>>Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in 
your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services

48-Mention the different types of instances in  Amazon EC2 and explain its features.

>>General Purpose Instances: They are used to compute a range of workloads and aid in the allocation of processing, memory, and networking resources.
>>Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, 
machine learning inference, and various other tasks
>>Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
>>Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are 
carried out using hardware accelerators.
>>Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage

49- What do you understand by 'changing' in Amazon EC2?

>>To make limit administration easier for customers, Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch from the current 'instance count-based limitations' to the new 
'vCPU Based restrictions.' As a result, when launching a combination of instance types based on demand, utilization is measured in terms of the number of vCPUs.

50-What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

>>Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.
>>When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.
>>Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.

51-With specified private IP addresses, can an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance be launched? If so, which Amazon service makes it possible?

>>Yes. Utilizing VPC makes it possible (Virtual Private Cloud).

52-What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?

>>Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing 
trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances 
launched from your AMI.

53-What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:

Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI

54-What are Key-Pairs in AWS?

>>A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data
The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances.
The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.

55-what EBS Volumes

>>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances
>>it is permanent storage/persistance
>>it can be increased to max of 16TB you can't decreased the ebs
>>it is availble in SSD and HDD

disadvantages:-
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system and it should be same availbility zone
>>it is only for linux

advantages:-
>>you can diretly mount to the system 
>>it can shared between multiple servers and multiple availbility zones

56 - Types of EBS-Volumes

===general purpose ssd gp2
>>it is cheaper compared to provisioned iops
>>it is high speed gp2  performance
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 16000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 3IOPS          -->input/output operations per second
>>you can't change iops you should use aws given iops

===gp3
>>it is also costly to gp2
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 3000
>>Maximum IOPS 16000

====IO1 Provisioned IOPS
>>it is costly compared to gp2 
>>it is also high spped performance
>>minimum 4GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 64000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 50IOPS
>>you change iops what you want you can modify the iops details

====IO2 Provisioned IOPS
>>it is costly compared to gp2 and IO1
>>it is also high spped performance
>>minimum 4GB to you can extend volume upto 64TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 256000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 1000IOPS
>>you change iops what you want you can modify the iops details

47 -===example for iops gp2&IO1

DB requirment given by client 10TB he needs 100000 IOPs using do storage

gp2:
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
1 x 2500 = 2.5TB 7000 iops you will get 
>>estimate cost of your monthly bill ($3650.90)
>>con: max 250mb/sec

===if you need 100000iops you need to increase gp2 instance but IO1 you can get easily

IO1
2 x 5120 = 100000 iops with each volume 50000iops
requirement is fullfield  but it is costly compared to gp2

eatimate cost of monthly bill ($8558)
con:max throughput 781mb/sec

===cold HDD and optimized HDD and Magnetic (standard)

>>remaining all drives is slow and it is cheaper 
>>it is used for storage purpose or testing servers purpose
>>when you cant use data regularly then you can use this

where we can sql databese we can use ebs volumes explaining beloow

>>windows or linux we can gp2 volume
>>system databases we can gp2 volume
>>user database we can use IO1 volume
>>database transaction logs we can use IO1 volume 
>>tempDB we can use we can use instance store or standard
>>page file i virtual memory we can use instance store or standard
>>backups  we can use magnetic or standard

58 - what is an Instance store

>>instance store is temporary storage data will be deleted if server reset
>> It cannot be increased or decreased
>>only ssd type is available
>> When you use instance storage while launching ec2 if the server restart or reset the data will be loose

59-what is EFS and what is the use case of it

>>Amazon Elastic File System is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services designed to provide scalable, 
elastic, concurrent with some restrictions, and encrypted file storage for use with both AWS cloud services and on-premises resources.
>>After you create an existing file system (EFS), you can't change its encryption setting. This means you can't modify an unencrypted 
file system to make it encrypted. Instead, you must: Create a new Amazon EFS file system with encryption turned on

uses cases:-
>> You can directly mount the system to ec2 instances
>> It is a shared folder for the network in a region
>>it is a network file system  
>> It is Unix or Linux supported
>>it can be shared between multiple servers and multiple regions
>> The storage limit 8PB

60-What is Amazon S3? 

S3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount
of data from anywhere. Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to 
these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance. 

>> We can store log files 
>> Maximum uploading one file size upto 5TB
>>it is objeted level stoarge
>> It is the global unique name
>> You can upload files 3types 1 - cli and 2 - aws console 3 - application through API or Jenkins
>> Mostly upload through API or application through
>>s3 bucket is not global why means when you create a bucket it asks for the region but it will show all the regions
>>s3 availability is 99.9 uptime
>>s3 durability is 99.999999 it will not go delete 
>> When you upload a file it will save in 3 az but it will not show that saving
>> It will charge when you upload and storage and when you access through the internet will cost 
>> You can enable version control

---storage types
>> If frequently using data means use this (standard)
>> If we can't access frequently that old data we can use this (standard, glacier)
>>temporary log files you can use this (One Zone-IA)

61-S3 life-cycle

>> You can create the bucket using create the lifecycle then which will save in the first 30 days standard if not frequently accessed that you can move that data into
standard-IA then this data also not frequently using then you can move into One-Zone-IA then move to S3-glacier it is permanent data storage for long-term
if you want to delete you can specify also after 1 or 2 or 10 years after also

62-what is S3 Replication

>> Transfer the data from one bucket to another bucket
>>craete bucket anji256 on that time you should enable the replication
>> It is use for mostly log-purpose of saving

=== How to add replication
>>click on add rule >>enable version
>>select bucket anji159
>> Select the storage type glacier or anything
>> Click on next done
>>if you upload data in the bucket of anji256 the data will save in the bucket of anji159

63-How many S3 buckets can be created?

Up to 100 buckets can be created by default

64-s3 bucket storage types

1-standard
2-standard I-A
3-onezone I-A
4-S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
5-S3 glacier

65-what is Glacier

>>s3 glacier cheap storage
>> For long-term backup, we can use this
>> If you stored data in Glacier if retrieving it  will charge it's not for regular purposes it's for longterm
>> You can take glacier backup using third-party tools fast glacier, altro, veritas, Netbackup,networker, Aavamar, Tivoli
>> Glacier is called the vault

66-can I store my EBS volume in an s3 bucket

>>When you create an EBS snapshot, it's automatically stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that's managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can copy snapshots
within the same AWS Region, or from one Region to another. However, you can't copy snapshots to the S3 buckets that you manage.

67-How can I grant a user access to a specific folder in my Amazon S3 bucket?

>>If your IAM user and s3 bucket are present in the AWS account then you can grant the user access to a specific bucket folder using the IAM policy

You can add the IAM policy to individual IAM users or you can attach the IAM policy to an IAM role that multiple users can switch to.
If the IAM identity (user or role) and the s3 bucket belong to different AWS accounts, then you 
must grant access to both the IAM policy and the bucket policy

68-What does bucket policy mean?

>>With Amazon S3 bucket policies, you can secure access to objects in your buckets, so that only users with the appropriate permissions can access them. 
You can even prevent authenticated users without the appropriate permissions from accessing your Amazon S3 resources.

69-can I copy my AMI into the s3 bucket?

>>You can store an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in an Amazon S3 bucket, copy the AMI to another S3 bucket, and then restore it from the S3 bucket.

70-what are the types of encryption in s3

>> Using AWS KMS policy using create the key assign to users then it will use encrypt the data 
two types of encryption there AWS KMS policies

1-symmetric key: the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt 
2-asymmetric key: different keys used to encrypt and decrypt

Server-side encryption – Amazon S3 encrypts your objects before saving them on disks in AWS data centers and then decrypts the objects when you download them. ...
Client-side encryption – You encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3.

71-Do you prefer to host a website on S3? What’s the reason if your answer is either yes or no?

>>Yes, it can be a good option to host a website on S3. Hosting a website on S3 is a cost-effective solution for static websites that don’t require server-side processing.
S3 is a reliable and scalable storage service that offers high availability and durability.
>>However, hosting a dynamic website with server-side processing on S3 is not recommended as it lacks the necessary computing resources and scalability to handle such websites.
In such cases, it’s better to use other AWS services like EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.

72-which is faster storage EBS or S3

EBS: EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. It offers low-latency, high-performance storage optimized for transactional workloads and applications
that require frequent read/write access to data. EBS volumes are typically used as primary storage for applications running on EC2 instances.

S3: S3, on the other hand, is an object storage service designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data. It is highly scalable and durable, offering high availability
and durability for data. S3 is accessed over the network and is well-suited for use cases such as data backup, data archiving, static website hosting, and content distribution.
>>The performance of EBS and S3 can vary based on several factors, including the storage class, instance type, network connectivity, workload characteristics, and access patterns. 
However, in general, EBS is designed for low-latency access and is optimized for performance-sensitive workloads, while S3 is optimized for scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness
at the expense of slightly higher latency.
>>It's important to consider the specific requirements of your application or use case when choosing between EBS and S3. If your application requires low-latency access to storage and
frequent read/write operations, EBS is usually the more suitable choice. On the other hand, if you have large volumes of unstructured data, require high scalability, or need to 
store data for long-term archival purposes, S3 is a better fit.

In summary, the "faster" storage option between EBS and S3 depends on your specific workload and requirements. It is recommended to analyze your application's needs and the characteristics
of the storage services to make an informed decision.

73-Your application needs to access AWS services, such as S3 securely within your VPC. How would you achieve this?

>>To securely access AWS services within the VPC, we can use VPC endpoints. VPC endpoints allow instances in the VPC to communicate with AWS services privately, without requiring
Internet gateways or NAT gateways. 
We can create VPC endpoints for specific AWS services, such as S3 and DynamoDB, and associate them with the VPC. 
This enables secure and efficient communication between the instances in the VPC and the AWS services.

74-S3 buckets offer several advantages, including:

Durability and availability: S3 provides high durability and availability for your data.
Scalability: You can store and retrieve any amount of data without worrying about capacity constraints.
Security: S3 offers multiple security features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging.
Performance: S3 is designed to deliver high performance for data retrieval and storage operations.
Cost-effective: S3 offers cost-effective storage options and pricing models based on your usage patterns.

75-hat is S3 Event Notifications and Triggers

>>S3 event notifications allow you to configure actions when specific events occur in an S3 bucket. For example, you can trigger AWS Lambda functions, send messages to 
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), or invoke other services using Amazon SNS when an object is created or deleted.

76-you have a VPC with a public subnet and private subnet. Instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates. How would you allow internet access for
instances in the private subnet?

>>To allow internet access for instances in the private subnet, we can use an Internet gateway or a NAT instance
>> We would place the NAT Gateway/instance in the public subnet and configure the private subnet route table to send outbound traffic to the NAT Gateway/instance. This way instances 
in the private subnet can access the internet through the NAT Gateway/instance.

77-you have launched EC2 instances in your VPC, and you want them to communicate with each other using private IP addresses. What steps would you take to enable this communication?

>>By default, instances within the same VPC can communicate with each other using private IP addresses. 
To ensure this communication, we need to make sure that the instances are launched in the same VPC and are placed in the same subnet or subnets that are connected through a peering 
connection or a VPC peering link. 
Additionally, we should check the security groups associated with the instances to ensure that the necessary inbound and outbound rules are configured to allow communication between them.

78-your organization has a VPC with multiple subnets you want to restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet but allow outbound internet access for resources in 
another subnet how would achieve this?

>>To restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet we can modify the route table associated with that subnet in the route table we can remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0)
that points to an internet gateway
>>This would prevent resources in that subnet from accessing the internet for the subnet where outbound internet access is required we can keep the default route pointing to the 
Internet gateway

79-you have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application. the application needs to be highly available and scalable how would you design the VPC architecture

>> In this scenario, I would design a VPC architecture in the following way.

I would create 2 subnets public and private the public subnet would contain the load balancer and be accessible from the internet. the private subnet would host the application servers.
I would distribute the subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability. Additionally, I would configure auto-scaling groups for the application servers.

80-Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads. How would you set up this isolated environment?

>>To set up an isolated environment within the VPC, we can create a subnet with no internet gateway attached. 
>>This subnet, known as an "isolated subnet," will not have direct internet connectivity. We can place the sensitive workloads in this subnet, ensuring that they are protected from 
inbound and outbound internet traffic. 
>>However, if these workloads require outbound internet access, we can set up a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a different subnet and configure the isolated subnet's route table to
send outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway/instance.

81-You want to implement strict network access control for your VPC resources. How would you achieve this?

>>To implement granular network access control for VPC resources, we can use Network Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. We can define inbound and outbound rules in the NACLs to allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, 
ports, and protocols. 
By carefully configuring NACL rules, we can enforce fine-grained access control for traffic entering and leaving the subnets.

82-You have a private subnet in your VPC that contains a number of instances that should not have direct internet access. However, you still need to be able to securely access these 
instances for administrative purposes. How would you set up a bastion host to facilitate this access?

>>To securely access the instances in the private subnet, you can set up a bastion host (also known as a jump host or jump box). The bastion host acts as a secure entry point to your 
private subnet. Here's how you can set up a bastion host: Create a new EC2 instance in a public subnet, which will serve as the bastion host. Ensure that this instance has a public IP 
address or is associated with an Elastic IP address for persistent access. Configure the security group for the bastion host to allow inbound SSH (or RDP for Windows) traffic from your
IP address or a restricted range of trusted IP addresses. This limits access to the bastion host to authorized administrators only. Place the instances in the private subnet and configure
their security groups to allow inbound SSH (or RDP) traffic from the bastion host security group.SSH (or RDP) into the bastion host using your private key or password. From the bastion host,
you can then SSH (or RDP) into the instances in the private subnet using their private IP addresses.

83-how to encrypt the unencrypted AMI

>>A Launch Configuration is a configuration template that specifies the parameters for launching instances in an ASG. It includes details such as the EC2 instance type, AMI ID, 
security groups, key pairs, block device mappings, and user data scripts. When creating an ASG, you associate it with a Launch Configuration. If the desired capacity of the ASG changes, 
the ASG automatically creates new instances based on the Launch Configuration settings

84-How have you ensured high availability and fault tolerance for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented AWS Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups to ensure that our application could handle sudden spikes in traffic and maintain high availability.
We also set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the application and alert us in case of any failures, allowing us to quickly respond and ensure fault tolerance.

85-Can you explain a time when you had to troubleshoot an issue with an AWS application?

>>In my previous role, we had an issue with an EC2 instance not responding to incoming traffic. After reviewing the logs, we discovered that the security group rules were misconfigured,
causing the instance to reject incoming traffic. We adjusted the security group rules to allow incoming traffic, and the issue was resolved.

86-how NAT-Gateway will work

>> When we use to launch the nat-gateway in the public subnet then we can add it to private route tables

87-Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?

Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, 
developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.
>>Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS

88-What is the maximum limit of elastic IPs anyone can produce?

>>A maximum of five elastic IP addresses can be generated per location and AWS account.

89-what is a storage gateway and what types

>>AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud storage services that provide on-premises access to virtually connect the cloud storage.

>>volume-gateway:- A Volume Gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
devices from your on-premises application servers.

>>File-gateway:- File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. 
With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.

>>Tape-gateway:-Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS without 
changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on premises for low-latency data access

90-What is auto-scaling?

>>Auto scaling groups must not be used for database
>> Auto scaling groups are used mostly used web and app servers because of static content
>>Auto-scaling is a function that allows you to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease 
resource capacity in relation to the demand.Cloud Architect Master's
-----types
1-Vertical Scaling:-
>>t2.micro to t4.medium 
>>its needs machine shutdown or downtime to increase the size of the specification

2-Horizontal Scaling:-
>>t2.micro to t2.micro 
>> If you want to increase the system means you need to use horizontal scaling

91-where we can use cloudwatch mostly in AWS

1-Auto-scaling --scaling policies
2-

92-How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?

>>Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:

State changes in Amazon EC2
Auto-scaling lifecycle events
Scheduled events
AWS API calls
Console sign-in events
amazon cloud watch

93-On an EC2 instance, an application of yours is active. Once the CPU usage on your instance hits 80%, you must reduce the load on it.What strategy do you 
use to complete the task?

>>It can be accomplished by setting up an autoscaling group to deploy additional instances, when an EC2 instance's CPU use surpasses 80% and by
allocating traffic across instances via the creation of an application load balancer and the designation of EC2 instances as target instances.

94-what is describe menas vpc

>>it will show the entire vpc details of vpcs

95-what Interface endpoint

>>An interface VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your Amazon VPC to supported AWS services. 
Interface VPC endpoints also connect to endpoint services hosted by other AWS customers and partners and AWS Marketplace partner services.

96-What is load balancer and how it works? and types of load balancer

>>A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests 
in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. 
>>load balancer is region dependent
>>you can add multiple target groups into load balancer

1- Network load balancer
>>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer whenever the first system not availble then distributes incoming traffic across
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.
>>it is an layer 4 in transpot layer 
>>it is use TCP and UDP protocals
>>direct traffic based on ip address
>>you can add multiple target groups into load balancer
>>Network, or Layer 4, load balancers can provide faster responses,
>>the deregistation delay is 300 seconds
>>it will check every 30 seconds for health checks if you cant reach the server then decalre as not reachable then forward the request to another server
>>if you use one port or listner like 80 you can't use that port onemore time
>>you can save your load balancer logs in s3 
>>it will support path based routing but you need to every time differnt ports or different listners everytime
>>it is region dependent
>>by default cross-zone load balancer is not-enabled you should enable if the required happens
>>it is suitable for single application or easy application

---What is an internal load balancer?
>>An internal (or private) load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside
a virtual network.A load balancer frontend can be accessed from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario

---what is external load balancer
>>The external load balancer is used to route external HTTP traffic into the cluster

2- Application load balancer
>>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer whenever the first system not availble then distributes incoming traffic across
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer

>>it is layer 7 in application layer
>>it uses https and http
>>it is only for web-applications
>>the deregistation delay is 300 seconds
>>you can save your load balancer logs in s3 
>>you can use one listner or port number of times
>>it is region dependent
>>by default cross-zone load balancer is enabled
>>it will check every 30 seconds for health checks if you cant reach the server then decalre as not reachable then forward the request to another server
>>it will support path based routing or url based routing
>>you can transfer the traffic using paths based in application load balancer or  you can use path based routing
>>you can create the multiple target group like home , movies, shows then use the path based routing or url based routing
>>it is used or suitable for complex applications 

97-If any one asking the my load balancer is in public my subnets is private can use this subnets to connect through internet 

>>yes you can connect through internet by using the load-balancer must be public .like when you create the load-balancer it will create in only public not private
you must put app and db servers in private only. you can connect or download patches using nat gateway

>>you can enable in load balancer to connect the particular ip only if your client asked to connect the your website through ip you can give this ip and 
and add that client ip in your load balancer only that client will connect

98-what is cross-zone load-balancer

>>The nodes for your load balancer distribute requests from clients to registered targets. When cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each load balancer 
node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones

>>you have load balancer and 1a availbility zone 4 servers and 1b availbilty zone have 2 servers if the traffic will then it will distribute 50 persent to 1a
and 50 persent 1b then it will get over trafficed by 1b so on that time you can use the cross-zone load balancer then it will distribute same amount of
traffic to every servers in availbilty zones

99-what is ssl-off loading or termination
>>SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic before passing it along to a web server.
            or
>>An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end-user's computer and web server by using a certificate for authentication. 
SSL termination helps speed the decryption process and reduces the processing burden on backend servers

100- what is round-robin load balancer              -->video 17 40mins

>>Round-robin DNS is a technique of load distribution, load balancing, or fault-tolerance provisioning multiple, redundant Internet Protocol service hosts, 
e.g., Web server, FTP servers, by managing the Domain Name System's (DNS) responses to address requests from client computers according to an appropriate 
statistical model        (or)
>>Round robin load balancing is a simple way to distribute client requests across a group of servers. A client request is forwarded to each server in turn.
How does it works:
>>What Is Round-Robin Load Balancing? Round‑robin load balancing is one of the simplest methods for distributing client requests across a group of servers. 
Going down the list of servers in the group, the round‑robin load balancer forwards a client request to each server in turn.

101-what is target group in load balancer

>>collections of machines and also specified protocols and ports to specified instances
         or
>>A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances, fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others. When creating a 
load balancer, you create one or more listeners and configure listener rules to direct the traffic to one target group

102-what is the use of health checks in aws

>>Health checks are a way of asking a service on a particular server whether or not it is capable of performing work successfully. 
Load balancers ask each server this question periodically to determine which servers it is safe to direct traffic to.

103-what is deregistration delay

>>Elastic Load Balancing stops sending requests to targets that are deregistering. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before completing the 
deregistration process,which can help in-flight requests to the target to complete
         or
>>Connection draining allows you to specify a maximum time (between 1 and 3,600 seconds and default 300 seconds) to keep the connections alive before reporting the
instance as de-registered. The maximum timeout limit does not apply to connections to unhealthy instances.

104-What is AZ affinity?

>>The AZ Affinity architectural pattern reduces the number of times an AZ boundary is crossed. In the example system we looked at in Figure 1, 
AZ Affinity can be implemented with two changes. First, the ALB is replaced with a Network Load Balancer (NLB).

105-what is gateway load balancer

>>Gateway Load Balancer helps you easily deploy, scale, and manage your third-party virtual appliances. It gives you one gateway for distributing traffic
across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up or down, based on demand.

106-What is a load balancer? Give scenarios of each kind of balancer based on your experience.

>>A load balancer is a device or service that distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any one server from becoming overwhelmed. 
There are three main types of load balancers:

1-Application Load Balancers (ALBs) distribute traffic based on content at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS).
2-Network Load Balancers (NLBs) distribute traffic at the transport layer (TCP/UDP).
3-Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances and can be used with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

107-How have you ensured high availability and fault tolerance for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented AWS Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups to ensure that our application could handle sudden spikes in traffic and maintain high availability.
We also set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the application and alert us in case of any failures, allowing us to quickly respond and ensure fault tolerance.

108-what is ASG and launch config

>>ASG:-ASG stands for Auto Scaling Group. It is a feature provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically adjusts the number of instances in a group based on the specified 
scaling policies. ASGs are commonly used to maintain the availability, performance, and cost-efficiency of applications running on EC2 instances.
Key features of Auto Scaling Groups include:
1-Automatic Scaling: 
2-High Availabilty:
3-Elasticity
4Integration with load-balancer
5-Integration with launch configurations

>> launch-config launch configuration is a template that an EC2 Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the 
instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping.

109-can I add multiple target groups in a load balancer

>>yes you can add multiple target groups. for example your created two servers server-1, server-2 your created server-1 in tg-1 target group and then created tg-2 target add server-2 then
create the application load balancer and the listeners tg-1 target group it will add 100% traffic to server-1. you can goto the load-balancer in listeners go to add rules edit 
load-balancer then add server-2 or target group and add 50% of traffic to server-1 and server-2 this will highly available

110-what is Route53 and what is the uses

>>Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web servic. Rout53 using we can host the domians.Route53 is global. 
route53 using you can do one region to another region load balancing.route53 using you can do multiple region load-balancing.  
>>Route53 provides DNS as a Service DNS->stands for Domain name service
>>DNS service is the one that maps your domain name with ip address or maps dns is that resolves your domain to the ip address if you assign the domain to the load-balancer
its resolve the domian name to the load-balancer
>>DNS keeps a lot of records
>>we use mostly routing policys simple, latency, falover, weighted

1-failover :- if we create two load balancer in differnt regions and create the helath checks in route 53 if we selectd the failover routing policy then we can 
create the same name of the website like www.anji.com is primary in mumbai region and www.anji.com is secondary in us-east-1 .whenever primary fails 
it will go secondary directly without checking the pings

2-weighted :- if we create weighted route policy route 53 it is like failover but the thing is you can mention the traffic which load balancer need to 
accessing the apllication over internet if we give 0 menas you can't access the application on that load balancer if we give 255 then we can access the 
loab balancer. the use case is we want maintaines on particular region you can diver the traffic into sepearte the specific load balancer
			(or)
Weighted round-robin:-two regions servers are the then we can divide the traffic based on priority based we can divide the traffic 
>>Weighted routing allows you to associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain (acme.example.com) and choose the amount of traffic routed for each resource.
This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software.

3-geo-DNS:-Geolocation routing can be used to send traffic to resources based on the geographical locations for example you may have presence in europe and Asia now you want user in the
Asia to be served in the Asia and rhose europe to be served by servers in europe
ex:-you can localize yourcontent present some or all of your website in the language of your user

4-latency:- latency is used same is the previous failover or weighted routing policy the differnt is you can mention to the particular in region if any one 
near by india that user will connect to the india based load balancer and if any us then that user will connect the us load balancer its region based. 
it is used to decrease the latency in your application to the users

what is traffic policies in route53
>>it will give the graphical representaion of dns records

111-What is the difference between AWS latency-based routing and geo DNS

Amazon maps-out typical latency between IP addresses and AWS regions. Choose Latency-based Routing to have the fastest response. Geolocation maps the IP addresses to geographic locations. 
This permits rules like "send all users from Côte d'Ivoire to the website in France", so they see a language-specific version

112-What is dns how it works

>DNS used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol
>>dns transfers human readble domain names for (example www.amazon.com)to machine  readble to ip address for example (192.168.0.24)
>>in your real time your isp will give dns address
>>most orgnazation disable ping to stop the ddos attacks by hackers
>>rembering name is easy but number are diffcult that we using dns names

113- what is hostname resolution 

>>HostName resolution is the process of associating names and IP addresses, and it's one of the most essential services on a network. 
People understand descriptive names, but network communications require difficult-to-remember addresses

114-how to create ssl-certifictae in aws

>>go to aws certificate manager create your domain name anji.com it will ask the email or domain validation then go to domain it will give name and cname
and create the record set in your route53 and create a record set the giev name and select the cname and it will give you certificate then go to your load balancer 
and add listener select the port and certficate then you good to go then delete the 80 port number that it . it take 10 to 15 minutes and to avoid the security instrucations
								(or)
>>you can create the certifictaes using third-party also using csr generator it will ask your domain name and give you public and private key then go to comodsslstore then 
you can create the certificate
								(or)
>>digcert, entrust provide ssl certficate
>>you need to create private.key and .csr file in your system and give that keys into authority digcert entrust they will give 3 files certification.crt and private.key and ca_bundle.crt
then you configure this certifictaes to webserver

115-what is ssh

>>the ssh protocal (also referred to as secure shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another computer.it provides the secure connection
to network. it provides several alternative options for strong authntication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption

116-what is Subdomain

>>A subdomain is a prefix added to a domain name to separate a section of your website. Site owners primarily use subdomains to manage extensive sections that
require their own content hierarchy, such as online stores, blogs or support platforms. Subdomains function as a separate website from its domain

117-what is mx record 

>>An MX record specifies the names of your mail servers and, if you have two or more mail servers, the priority order. Each value for an MX record contains
two values, priority and domain name. An integer that represents the priority for an email server.

118-what is simple record in aws

>>Simple routing lets you configure standard DNS records, with no special Route 53 routing such as weighted or latency. With simple routing, you typically 
route traffic to a single resource, for example, to a web server for your website. You can use simple routing policy for records in a private hosted zone.

119-what is cname records in aws

>>cname is also called canincal name or alias 
>>CNAME records are Directs one name to another name or Points domain to Another Domain www.anji.com to sampi.anji.com
>>so when you move your servers you only have to change one set of records

120-what is A name record in aws

>>A known as Host records it converts host to ip address 
>>A Records are IPv4
>>AAAA Records are IPv6
>>Amazon Route 53 offers a special type of record called an 'Alias' record that lets you map your zone apex (example.com) DNS name to the DNS name for your
ELB load balancer (such as my-loadbalancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com).

121-what is the differnce between A and CNAME record

>> the difference between CNAME and A record in a traditional NameServer is that only CNAME can be used to point to a different subdomain and A record must 
point to a valid IP address. Since the AWS Route53 allows you to do use a subdomain with either A Rec or CNAME

122-what is NS record

>>>>it is name server records when you creating or hosting website it will create the name server reocrds that will be fault tolerance purpose if any one goes down your
will not impact why 
because reaminig will run right
>>The NS records and A records are both used to provide DNS services. The difference between them is that the former define the servers that provide
DNS services for a domain name while the A records translate hostnames (such as www, FTP, mail) into IP addresses.

123-Is it possible to create one webserver under we can create 3 domains

>>yes its possible you can 3 folders like anji.com sampi.com vinod.com under deploy your code each domain code route the traffic based on DNS 
then you will access one-webserver using access 3 differnet domains in one ec2 system

124-what is reverse proxy

>>A reverse proxy is a server or service that sits between client devices and backend servers. When a client makes a request, it is forwarded to the reverse proxy, which then acts as 
an intermediary and routes the request to the appropriate backend server. The response from the server is then returned to the client through the reverse proxy. The client is unaware of
the backend server and communicates only with the reverse proxy.

125-what is mod_proxy 

>>mod_proxy and related modules implement a proxy/gateway for Apache HTTP Server, supporting a number of popular protocols as well as several different load-balancing algorithms. 
Third-party modules can add support for additional protocols and load balancing algorithms.

126-what is the differnce between reverse proxy and mod_proxy

>>In summary, a reverse proxy is a general concept referring to a server or service that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers. On the other hand, mod_proxy is a 
specific module within the Apache HTTP Server that enables reverse proxy functionality and provides additional features and configurations for proxying requests.

127-what is Cloud-Native

>>Cloud native is the software approach of building, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments. Modern companies want to build highly scalable, flexible,
and resilient applications that they can update quickly to meet customer demands

Benifites
>>Increase efficiency
>>Reduce Cost
>>Ensure Availability
>>Faster development
>>Platform independence
>>Cost-effective operations

EX:-Docker kubernetes

128-what is firewall

>>firewall is allow or disallow the traffic in your network
>>firewall is security group it is used to control the incoming and outgoing traffic

>>firewall are two types

1 - stateless
>>it is not two-way handshake
>>Stateless firewalls make use of a data packet's source, destination, and other parameters to figure out whether the data presents a threat. These parameters have to be entered by either
an administrator or the manufacturer via rules they set beforehand

2 - stateful firewall
>>it is two-way handshake  process
>>A stateful firewall inspects everything inside data packets, the characteristics of the data, and its channels of communication. Stateful firewalls examine the behavior of data packets,
and if anything seems off, they can filter out the suspicious data. Also, a stateful firewall can track how the data behaves, cataloging patterns of behavior. 

>>it is used to allow the one side no need to allow other side it will remeber and send the packets
>>stateful firewall remebers the connection details it will give replay

3 - In-Bound rule

>> Inbound firewall rules protect the network against incoming traffic, such as disallowed connections, malware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

4 - Out-Bound rule

>>Outbound firewall rules protect against outgoing traffic, originating inside a network.

129-What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?

>>Distributed denial of service DDOS the main intention is to making unavilable over thr internet in a website or some resources. the hacker send the multiple
requests into website is going unavailble over the internet

AWS Shield
AWS WAF
Amazon Route53
Amazon CloudFront
ELB
VPC

130-What is whitelisting an IP address?

>>IP whitelisting is when you grant network access only to specific IP addresses. Each employee (or approved user) shares their home IP address with the 
network administrator, who then enters their IP address on a “whitelist” that grants them network access.

131--What is the advantage of using a “reverse proxy server”?

>>The reverse proxy server can hide the presence and characteristics of the origin server. It acts as an intermediate between internet cloud and web server.
It is good for security reason especially when you are using web hosting services.

132-what is Baston Host

>>Bastion Hosts are a special-purpose instanxe that provides seccure access to linux instacnes located in private subnets
>>Act as a jump server to access other instances in private subnets
>>protect instances in private subnets from potential attacks 

133-How Bastion Host work

>>Ec2 instances in private subnets are protected by security group and NACLs, only allow secure connection from Bastion Host

>>Security Group of Bastion Host only allow SSH from trusted IP Address
>>use ssh agent forwarding on a client do not store private key on bastion host

134-without password how can access linux machines

>>you need to create the sshkey it is uses in rsa alogirthum it will create 2 files public key file named . ssh/id_rsa. pub and a private key file named . ssh/id_rsa.
you can add that public key into the remote server you must enable the password less authentication in remote servers
>>vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
passwordauthentication yes
permitrootlogin yes
#passwordauthentication no  -->you need comment this 
>>scp -r /home/anji.tx  2.54.25.2:/root/anji    -->it will send the file  
two ways to send the file password less like add your ssh keys in destination server or password authentication need to give password

>>ssh-keygen
>>press enter
>>press enter
>>ls -a
>>cd .ssh
>>ls
>>ssh-copy-id anji@172.31.38.167   -->it will ask passwd give next time it will not ask do same in remaing systems

135-how you can see if the port is opened or not in linux

>>>>netstat -a | grep -i 8000     -->to check the port opening and listening
>>telnet "ip" port

136-What are the kinds of security attacks that can occur on the cloud? And how can we minimize them?

>>The kinds of security attacks that can occur on the cloud include DDoS attacks, phishing attacks, data breaches, and insider attacks. To minimize them, it is important to use
strong authentication methods, implement proper access control and monitoring, encrypt data, keep systems up to date with security patches, and regularly conduct security audits and 
training for employees.

137-What is the difference between the Amazon Rds, Dynamodb, and Redshift?

Amazon RDS: Relational database service that allows you to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud easily.

DynamoDB: Fully-managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Redshift: Data warehousing service that provides fast querying and analysis of data using SQL and business intelligence tools.

138-Explain the difference between elasticity from scalability?

>>Elasticity : The ability of a system to handle an increase in the workload by simply adding hardware resources when demand rises, and rolling back scaled resources when there’s no demand.

>>Scalability : ability of a system to increase the hardware resources for handling an increase in demand. It can be achieved by either increasing the hardware specs or increasing the 
number of processing nodes.

139-what is latency 

>> Latency is nothing but the time taken by request to reach the application and for the application and the server to send the response back to you
If there is a delay that is high latency
if there is no delay that is low latency

140-what are tags in what is the use of tags?

>>A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only 
one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level.

141-why AWS block port 25 in outbound ports

>>Amazon Web Services' EC2 instances are throttled on port 25 by default as a spam prevention measure. This can cause connection issues when attempting to use SMTP to relay emails 
through Postmark in your EC2 instance

142-you can block the certain ip and some countries using AWS WAF 

>>Yes its possible to block certain region

143- what is operating system

>>it is an user interface between user and hardware is called operating system

144-Can I Retrieve Data from a Deleted ELB or Ec2 Instance?

>>Metrics data for deleted ELBs and decommissioned EC2 instances are still available. MetricsData associated with a terminated instance will be removed when the Instance is shut down. 
In contrast, MetricsData associated with your account will remain on the MetricInfraService until you delete it. This information can be used for diagnosing problems with your ECS cluster 
or ELB.

145-If I disable monitoring for an Ec2 instance, will I lose the metrics data?

>>No, the metrics data will not be lost.
>>If you disable monitoring for an EC2 instance, the metrics you've collected are still safely preserved in a SQL database as part of the AWS CloudTrail logs.

146-What is RDS AWS used for?

>>Amazon RDS managed by amazon and it makes easy to setup operate and scale a relational database in the cloud it provides cost efficient and resizable capacity
while automating time consuming administartion tasks. such as hardware provisioning database setup patching and backups
>>Amazon RDS is availble on several databases instance types optimized for memory performance I/O provides familar database like aurora, postgresssql,mysql,mariadb,
oracle database, sql server

>>RDS is structred database
>>RDs is platform as service(paas)
>>you can create read replcia in another region also us-east-1a to ap-south-1a
>>if you createing an database automatically it will create two databases in a region but they don't know
it will connect in primary database ,the primary will sync to secondary database ,if in case primary not availble then secondary will connect 
>>if the primary available zone damaged not available then it will create onemore database in availble region like us-east-1c
>>you will connect only primary database
>>you can't access secondary why because where the database is there don'tknow

147-what is the rds failover time

>>60-120 seconds

148-rds database tpes

1-master(primary)
2-read(secondary)replica       -->you can create read replica

>>some tester has come and asked we test the rds you're not giving the primary you dont
know how to access the secondary that time you can use the read replica
>>read replica just copy a primary you can put another region also
>>in read replica you can't write on the database its only read option

149-Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

>>No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose
of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.

150-How would you address a situation in which the relational database engine frequently collapses when traffic to your RDS instances increases, given that the RDS instance replica
is not promoted as the master instance?

>>A larger RDS instance type is required for handling significant quantities of traffic, as well as producing manual or automated snapshots to recover data if the 
RDS instance fails

151- What is SQL Server in simple words?

>>SQL Server is a database server by Microsoft. The Microsoft relational database management system is a software product which primarily stores and retrieves data
requested by other applications. These applications may run on the same or a different computer

152-What is AWS redshift used for?

>>it is type of database it belong to postgress sql.it used for data ware-housing purpose
>>Amazon Redshift uses SQL to analyze structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes,
using AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price performance at any scale

153-what is elastiCahe in aws

>>elastcahe is not regular satabase it is web-service that makes easy to launch manage and scale distributed in memory cache in the cloud
it is used to improve your website or web-application performance. it will cache the services in that memory it will increase the better performance
>>it like ec2-service
 
two types:-
1-memcahed 
2-redis

154-What is DocumentDB used for?

>>it like mongo database
>>A document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. Document databases make 
it easier for developers to store and query data in a database by using the same document-model format they use in their application code.

155-how do you backup rds server

>>you need to create first option group and select the version and type of your database and then create your option group. then go to s3 create bucket and role
for s3 and then go that group attach the role and bucket and select the backup and restore it will 

156-what is snapshots

>>Snapshots are a point-in-time copy of your data, and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts,
and improve backup compliance. 

157-how to make rds highly available

>>multi AZ deployment high availbilty & fail over for disaster recovery
read replicas provide high performance for read heavy workloads
automatic database software updates
easy to scale compute memory stoarge
automated backups and manula backups
encryption at rest (AWS KMS) andd transit SSL

158-how to make rds highly availble

>>you can create the one RDS-Database then created the read replicas in 2 more availbilty zones then and also your servers are in different availbility zones like 
az1->RDS(read-write) az2->RDS(read only), az3->RDS(read only) if the any traffic will go az2 then it will take data from az2->RDS only if any want write then it will az1->RDS
why because it will have only read and write permisssion this will make your RDS highly availble and fast your database

159-How have you implemented disaster recovery for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented disaster recovery for an AWS application by using AWS Route 53 to route traffic to a secondary region in case of a failure in the primary region. 
We also set up Amazon S3 cross-region replication to ensure that the data was replicated to the secondary region in real-time. Additionally, we created automated backups of the
application data using Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier to ensure that we could quickly restore the data in case of a disaster.

160-Can you describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a performance issue in an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we had an issue where the application was slow to respond to user requests. After reviewing the logs, we identified that the application was experiencing high CPU
usage. We then analyzed the application’s resource utilization using Amazon CloudWatch and identified that the database queries were taking longer than expected. We optimized the database
queries and improved the performance of the application.

161-Can you explain a time when you implemented security measures for an AWS application?

>>In my previous role, we implemented several security measures for an AWS application, including setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all AWS accounts, enabling AWS CloudTrail
to monitor and log all API activity, and encrypting data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). We also regularly conducted vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to
identify and mitigate potential security risks.

162-How would you use AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 for a scalable and highly available static website?

>>AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 can be used together to build a scalable and highly available static website. Here’s an overview of the process:

>>Store the website files in an Amazon S3 bucket and make the files publicly accessible.

>>Create a CloudFront distribution, which is Amazon’s global content delivery network (CDN), and configure it to use the S3 bucket as its origin. This allows CloudFront to serve the 
website files from edge locations around the world, ensuring fast and low-latency access for visitors.

>>Use Amazon Route 53, the highly available and scalable DNS service, to associate a custom domain name with the CloudFront distribution, so visitors can access the website using a 
familiar and memorable domain name.

>>Configure Route 53 to use the health checks and failover features to ensure that the website is always available, even if one of the edge locations becomes unavailable. Finally, 
use S3’s versioning and lifecycle policies to automatically store multiple versions of the website files and to transition older versions to less expensive storage options over time.

163-Can you describe a scenario in which you would use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy an application?

>>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to easily deploy, run and scale web applications. 
The service is ideal for situations where a developer has created a web application using a popular framework, such as Ruby on Rails, Node.js, or Java, and is looking to quickly deploy
the application to a production environment with minimal overhead. AWS Elastic Beanstalk takes care of provisioning the necessary resources, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, 
databases and security groups, and sets up a fully functional environment for the application. This eliminates the need for the developer to manage the underlying infrastructure, 
freeing them up to focus on the development and maintenance of the application itself. Monitoring the health of the application can be done using AWS Elastic Beanstalk’s built-in monitoring 
and reporting features, and updates and changes can be made as needed. This makes AWS Elastic Beanstalk a simple, streamlined solution for deploying and managing web applications, 
particularly well-suited for developers who want a straightforward way to handle the deployment and management of their applications.

164-How would you implement a disaster recovery solution in AWS using RDS, EC2, and S3?

>>Create an Amazon RDS instance in a primary region, and configure automatic backups to Amazon S3.
>>Create an Amazon EC2 instance in the same primary region
>>Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store data backups, and configure the RDS instance to store backups in the S3 bucket.
>>Set up an Amazon EC2 instance in a secondary region and install the necessary software to access the S3 bucket.
>>Create an Amazon RDS instance in the secondary region and configure it as a replica of the primary RDS instance.
>>Configure the secondary RDS instance to automatically fail over to the primary RDS instance in case of a disaster in the secondary region.
>>Regularly test the failover process to ensure it is working as expected.
>>Use Amazon S3 versioning and object lifecycle management policies to retain backups for a desired period of time.
>>Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the RDS instances and EC2 instances, and set up alarms to trigger notifications or automated actions in case of a disaster.

165-what Required to connect the MySQL or RDS or any databse

>>The account that is used to connect to the MySQL database must have at least CONNECT permissions. This enables SSMA to obtain metadata from schemas owned by the connecting user.
1-connection permission any network or locally
2-mysql endpoint
3-port number should be open
4-username and password
5-mysql workbench or jdbc connection

166-Define Snapshots in Amazon Lightsail?

>>A snapshot is a base feature for creating backups of your EBS volumes. A snapshot takes a copy of the EBS volume and places it in Amazon S3, where it is 
stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones. The initial snapshot is a full copy of the volume; ongoing snapshots store incremental block-level changes only
>>and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts, and improve backup compliance

167-what is AWS Backup

>> AWS Backup features .AWS Backup is like snapshots. in every organzation need to take a backup some of the particular resources with using of aws backup take some of major 
resources in aws backup automatically or daily backup no need to write script you can do automated backup on time bases like you can schedule and store the backup in s3 directly
>>your specify the some of the resource in aws to take backup on AWS Backup service. on which time you need . you can take partcular time take backup between
partcular  resource to take the backup. its nothing but snapshots

what is backup vault
>>its like glacier vault where we can storing data or saving the data is called backup vault

168-how many types of backup

>>two types
1-automatic
two types
a-daily backup
b-transactionlogs
2-snapshots

two types of RDS backup 

1-Automated backups:- it will store in s3
>>RDS automatically create backs up your database and transaction logs
>>RDS automcatically create a storage volumes snapshots of your DB instances backuing up the entire DB intsance
>>Automated backups occur daily during the preferred nackup window
>>Automated backups are kept for the Backup Retention period (0 to35 Days)
>>you can restore the DB instances to specify point in time during the bcakup retention period
creating a new DB instances

2-Databse snapshots

>>Database snapshots are user-initiated backups of the DB instance stored in s3
>>DB snapshots are kept intil explicitly delete them
>>you cna creae a DB instance by restoring from DB snapshots
>>the first snapshots contains the data for the full DB instance subsequent snapshots of the
same DBinstance are incremenetl

A warning about a specific resource (e.g., a virtual machine).
A regular notification for a specific metric (e.g., CPU usage).
A user-defined alarm (for example, if your application runs slowly, the alarm will trigger when the CPU reaches 80% and notify you immediately).
A personalized alarm based on user-defined rules.

180-What Statistics Can I View And Graph In Cloudwatch?

>>Disk I/O Activity
>>Memory Share 
>>CPU Usage
>>Memory Usage
>>Network Interface Usage.

181-What is the data retention period in CloudWatch?

>>You can change the log data retention setting for CloudWatch logs. By default, logs are kept indefinitely and never expire. You can adjust the retention policy for each log group, 
keeping the indefinite retention, or choosing a retention period between 10 years and one day.

182-What is the difference between CloudWatch and CloudTrail?

>>CloudWatch is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services that monitors and reports on the performance of various AWS resources and services.
>>CloudTrail, on the other hand, is a log of all actions in your AWS environment since it was first launched.

183-What is CloudWatch events used for?

>>Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. 
Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.

184-What services can be used to create a centralized logging solution?

>>The essential services that you can use are Amazon CloudWatch Logs, store them in Amazon S3, and then use Amazon Elastic Search to visualize them.
You can use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to move the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon ElasticSearch.
>>if your service is stopped are anything happen you can create a rule to trigger your script and send the notifications
(like if your lamabda function to stop the start and specific time then youy can use the rules it will be changed)

185-How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?

>>Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:

State changes in Amazon EC2
Auto-scaling lifecycle events
Scheduled events

Console sign-in events
amazon cloud watch

186-What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?

>>Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others.
Let’s take a look at two services in specific:

1-AWS CloudTrail:
>>cloudtrail is used to see th login logut details and activitesits not give detailed information
>>cloudtrail is data will save only 90 days, so we can import that into aws s3 or any centrailzied locations

2-AWS Config:
>>first enable select the resource what you need the resource type and enable recording on 
>>AWS config is used to track the details of what you changed on your instances or modfied your instances.  if you chnaged something in your ec2-instances 
it will automatically shows what you updated in your system it will and it will save in until 7 years

>>AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration 
change notifications to enable security and governance.

187-How would you use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to monitor and log AWS resource activity and events?

>>AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch are two services that can be used to monitor and log AWS resource activity and events. CloudTrail records API calls made to AWS services and stores 
information about the caller, time of call, source IP address, request parameters, and response elements. This information can be used to track changes to AWS resources and identify 
security threats. CloudTrail trails can be created to specify the AWS resources for which API calls should be recorded and logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for central storage and analysis.

>>CloudWatch Alarms can be set up to trigger when specific conditions are met, such as when an API call is made to a sensitive AWS resource. Alarms can be configured to send notifications 
to specified Amazon SNS topics or to stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance. The logs collected by CloudTrail and stored in CloudWatch Logs can be analyzed to identify trends, 
track resource activity, and diagnose issues.

>>By using CloudTrail and CloudWatch, organizations can have a comprehensive view of AWS resource activity and events, enabling them to identify security threats, troubleshoot issues,
and meet compliance requirements. The centralized logging and analysis provided by these services helps organizations to ensure the security and availability of their AWS resources, 
giving them greater control and visibility into their cloud infrastructure.

188-What is CDN and how it works?

>>A CDN or cloud-front is same. content deliver network is decrese the latency in your website and it provide the cache server in all edge locations 
on your website.it is used to speedup your website over the internet

189-what is global acclerator

>>it is like cloud-front or CDN. CDN provides cache server but global-acclerator gives to allow ports and give you can configure fixed entry-points to ip address  
>> AWS Global accelerator is a networking service that helps you to improve the availability zones and performance of the applications that offer you to your 
golbal users. aws global acclerator easy to setup and manage and configure. it provides static ip address and fixed entry point your application. 
global acclerator is basically global load balancer which load balancing the regions as well .it is costly compared to dns load balancer

190-what is WAF in AWS

>>it can provide the additional security of your web application. it will hide your servers on the internet
it will prevent cyber attacks like sql injection and xss and ddos attacks
