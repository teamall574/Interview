1 - what is IAAS

>>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a service. the cloud provider provides the Infrastructure to the developers
like network, storage, virtualization,servers can managed by cloud provider
>>this not physical things.it will provide only infrastructure. like vms,compute,memory,OS,network,storage,firewall. things you have full control on virtual machines
ex:- Virtual machines 

>>users are managed by operating system and middle ware, runtime data application all are managed by developers
>>by using IAAS to develop the application is very hard by compared to PAAS
Advantages:-
1-controling is high because you controlled
2-cost saving
3-scalibility. 
4-faster time to market
5-expand as you grow
6-tight security
7-anytime any where access
Disadvantages:-
1-no internet no work
2-privacy is limited
3-virtualization depend

2 - what PAAS
 
>>this not physical things.the PAAS will give platform for your application. for example you have an appliation or java or dot net application
there is no database person in your team you can ask the cloud service provide he will give the database and mantainance. things you dont have full control 
on virtual machines
>>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and 
operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.

>>the disadvantage you can't customize the things in you can't troubleshoot and changes you can trade-off or compromise. you can customize but limited things only
ex:- Azure sql and App-service it is managed by the Azure you can't control anything
  
3 - what is SAAS

>>this not physical things. it is readmade product. like office 365 or google apps or salesforce .it will give full software service. its controling on you 
it is very limited 
>>SAAS is pre-existed application that applications are accessible through internet connection and web-browsers 
like google chrome, gmail, mozila browser, salesforce

4-what is cloud-computing

>>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers,
you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

5-what is Total upfront,Partial upfront

>>Upfront:-your paying bill first then he will give some discount 
>>Partial upfront:- you can pay 50% of bill and then you can use remaing amount will pay after the month end bill generation time
>>No Upfront:- this is on-demand systems

6-what is 1-tier application

>>In 1-tier architecture, the data is directly provided to the user and that user can directly use the database through the computer. Any changes or updates that are done will reflect 
directly to the database

7-what is 2-tier application

>>Two-tier architecture. In a two-tier architecture, the client is on the first tier. The database server and web application server reside on the same server machine, which is the second tier.
This second tier serves the data and executes the business logic for the web application.

8-can you explain 3tier architecture or elbrate them

>>first we have extranal load balancer and internal load balancer then the extranal load balancer is open to the internet
through route53 and internal load balancer is between app and web and the app is connected to database

>>using public and private subnets

9-what is Front-end 

>>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—the part users see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using 
web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app
HTML,CSS, javascript, angular, react-js, Boot-strap, vue-js, Django, Swift, nodejs
port number 80 or 443
>>you will see the visual of application

10-what is backend

>>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing 
on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
java, python, .net, PHP, Nodejs,Go, C#
port number is 8080 or anything
>>java .net python  working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website

11-what is database

>>Databases often store information about people, such as customers or users. For example, social media platforms use databases to store user information, such as names, email addresses 
and user behavior. The data is used to recommend content to users and improve the user experience
mysql, RDS, Nosql, mongoDB, Oracle, PostgresSQl 
port number is 3306 or any other port 

12-how would you know which library is using in code

>>we run before packing the application we can run unit testing and compile the code using maven tool
>>we dont know which librarys using so that why we combine source code + librarys create into war or jar file
>>we can check the pom.xml all the librays and it contains information about the project and configuration details plugins goals and versions we can check only pom.xml
the build toolis 
java: maven
Dotnet: MSBuild
node js: NPM
python: no need to use build tool in python it is not inter-preted language. it will automaticaly install required packages using pip module

13-what is library

>>without library application will not work. library is nothig but its 3rd party application we will use the librarys to make up or development the application is more easy

14-what is this

>>if my project is java i will take maven as build tool
>>if my project is Android i will take graddle as build tool
>> Weservers are nginx, apache2,Caddy,monkey http server which will directly take the traffic which direcly rout to app servers
apache2 -->in ubuntu 80 port
httpd    -->in RHEL 80 port
nginx  -->80 port
>>app servers is an tomcat,JBoss,WildFly,Oracle weblogic
tomcat  -->8080 port 

jenkins   -->8080
sonarqube   -->9000
jfrog    -->8081
Nexus    -->8081

15-How many ways to Access the AWS

>>By using management console
>>access_kay and secret_key
>>AWS SDKs(software development Kits): using python boto3
>>AWS SSO(single sign-on) using anji@wipro.com
>>AWS Federation like SAML or Okta
>>AWS STS(Security token Service)

16-your unable to SSH into a linux server what steps would you take to troubleshooot this

>>check if the server is running and network accessible 
>>you can use the oing command to see if the serevr is reachable
>>check if the SSH port is open or not
>>check the firewall rules
>>check ssh configuration

17-how much time would take while launching installing

linux: minimum 3 minutes maximum 4 minutes (its requires minumum 8gb storage)
windows: minimum 4 minutes maximum 5 minutes (its requires minimum 30 gb storage)

18-Can we recover the EC2 instance when we have lost the key?

>>Yes, it is possible to recover an EC2 instance when you have lost the key. You can create a new key pair and then use it to connect to the instance.
Alternatively, you can also use other authentication methods such as user name and password, or even IAM roles to access the instance.
However, if you have encrypted the root volume of the instance using the lost key pair, you will not be able to recover the data on that volume.

19-how to restore the login into ec2 if pem file lost

>>Use a backup or a copy of the original .pem file:

If you have a backup or a copy of the original .pem file stored securely, you can use it to regain access to the EC2 instance.
Locate the backup or copy of the .pem file and follow the standard procedure to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key.

>>Launch a new EC2 instance and attach the original volume:

Launch a new EC2 instance and make sure to select the same availability zone and the same or compatible Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as the original instance.
During the instance launch, you can create a new key pair or choose an existing key pair to associate with the new instance.
Once the new instance is running, stop it and detach its root volume.
Detach the root volume from the original EC2 instance (the one for which you lost the .pem file).
Attach the original volume as a data volume to the new instance.
Start the new instance and access it using the new key pair. You can then mount the original volume and retrieve any necessary files.

>>Use EC2 Instance Connect or Session Manager:

If you have EC2 Instance Connect or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager set up on the EC2 instance, you may be able to regain access without the need for the .pem file.
EC2 Instance Connect allows you to connect to your EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI without a key pair. Check if EC2 Instance Connect is enabled for your
instance and follow the instructions provided by AWS. AWS Systems Manager Session Manager allows you to establish a secure shell (SSH) session to your instance through the AWS Management 
Console or the AWS CLI. If Session Manager is enabled for your instance, you can connect to it without needing the .pem file.

20-How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime?

>>To upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime, you can use the following steps:
1-Set up a load balancer in front of your system.
2-Deploy the new version of your system to a new set of servers.
3-Add the new servers to the load balancer and verify that they are healthy.
4-Remove the old servers from the load balancer.
5-Monitor the system to ensure that everything is running smoothly.
By following this process, you can ensure that your system remains available throughout the upgrade or downgrade process.

21-How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime?

>>You can upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime using the following steps of migration:

Open EC2 console
Choose Operating System AMI
Launch an instance with the new instance type
Install all the updates
Install applications
Test the instance to see if it’s working
If working, deploy the new instance and replace the older instance
Once it’s deployed, you can upgrade or downgrade the system with near-zero downtime.

22-what is the secret_key and access_key

>>Access keys consist of an access key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS. 
If you don't have access keys, you can create them by using the IAM console

>>AWS access key ID is a form of unique user/account identifier. AWS secret key is like private key. When AWS CLI sends a API request, 
the payload is signed by generating an HMAC with the secret key as the key

23-Is node.js will supoort backend and frontend

>>yes node.js will support frontend and backend also
3 tier arch
database:- MongoDB or Postgres or MySQL
frontend-web-application:- nodejs (webapp)
backend-end-application:-  nodejs (app-servers) or java

24-what is virtualization

>>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, 
storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs)

25-What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?

>>Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separately from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record 
in the root block device of your image.
>>Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
>>Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.

26-Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific

>>AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront

27-Define and explain the three basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them?

--The three basic types of cloud services are:

>>Computing: - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsail.
>>Storage - These include S3-simple service storage, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.
>>Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53

28-what is VPC

>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. 

>>it is a region dependent
>>Vpc is a logical boundary
>>vpc id is globally unique
>>you can stop the particular ip one ec2 to another ip through routing table in peering

29-what is Subnet

>>A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You launch AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your subnets. You can connect a subnet to the internet, other VPCs,
and your own data centers, and route traffic to and from your subnets using route tables.

30-what is Route tables in AWS

>>A Route table defines how the communication should happen with in the subnet and outside of subnet
>>we can create custom route tables per each subnet design the network traffic
>>route table play key role when you want route traffic to 
-other vnets
-virtual network gateways
-virtual appliances
-internet
>>it is also subnet level

31-What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

>>AWS regions are separate geographical areas, like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai). On the other hand, availability zones
are the areas that are present inside the regions. These are generally isolated zones that can replicate themselves whenever required.
>>The AWS Cloud spans 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions
>>20 per Region you can request need more
>>ou can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a 
maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.

32-what is nat-gateway

>>A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. it is used in private system to connect over the internet to take patches or update 
nat gateway is intellignet device using source destination packets. it will send only traffic through the public instance but not allow outside the 
traffic to your private instances.when you enabling nat gateway you must select the public subnet not the private subnet
 
33 - what is NAT-Instance

>>NAT-A NAT (Network Address Translation) instance is, like same nat-instance gateway but the differnce is the amount is big is nat gateway when compared
to nat instance

34 - What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?
 
NAT-Gateway
1 - nat gateway managed by aws 
2 - nat gateway canot assigned security groups
3 - nat gateway highly availble
4 - nat gateway bandwidth is upto 45 mbps
5 - nat gateway perfomance is good

NAT-Instance
1 - nat instance managed by you
2 - nat instance can assignes security groups
3 - nat instance is also highly availble
4 - nat instance bandwidth is depends on instnace bandwidth
5 - nat instance performance compared to nat gateway is average

35-what is Vpc End-point

>>A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services. instance in your vpc do not require public ip
address to communicate the aws resources
>>S3
>>DynmoDB
>>Also create Interfaces like EkS,Auto-Scaling,Cloud-Trail,Cloud-formation

36-what is gateway 

>>A gateway refers to a network component that acts as an entry or exit point for traffic entering or leaving a cloud environment. It serves as a bridge between different networks or 
systems and enables communication and data transfer between them. Gateways can be used for various purposes, such as security, monitoring, load balancing, and routing. Examples of 
cloud gateways include API gateways, database gateways, and messaging gateways.

gateawy is hardware device that gives you entry and exit point in your network
>>gateway end-point is a gateway that you specific as a target for a route in your table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service

37-what is VPC Perrring

>>A VPC peering  is a networking connection between two VPCs or two differnet networks. that enables you to route traffic between 
two differnt networks or two vpcs. once perring comleted they can communicate each other as if they are within the same network

>>there is no charges in vpc perring
>>you can also create the vpc peering one region mumbai to another region ohio like this
>>you can also vpc peering one account to another account

===disadvantages of peering

>>increase in the vpc will increase in the vpc peerings
>>each vpc needs a vpg for vpn connections

38-What is a transit gateway?

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring, in vpc perring if we created 3 or more vpc we need interconnect using vpc perring if we increase vpc perring its
diffcult to identify the traffic and get confused invpc perring. so that we using transit gateway we create one transit gateway we can interconnect the
vpc in a region its easy to understand easy to use. we can interconnect differnt region also easy way. but it is chargble

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring. the transit gateway simplifies your network connection and puts an end to complex peering relationships.
Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud router—each new connection is made only once

39-what is NACL

>>A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

>>when you created vpc automatically create nacl 
>>if anyone want say to change something nacl first ask send a mail 
>>don't do changes in nacl in production environment
>>need to add every rule in inbound and outbound  -->if you add ssh in inbound it will not allow so you need to add outbound also

40-what is security group is stateful or stateless in aws

>>Security groups are stateful—if you send a request from your instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of 
inbound security group rules. For VPC security groups, this also means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of 
outbound rules.

41-What is the difference between security group and NACL?

>>Security Group is applied to an instance only when you specify a security group while launching an instance.NACL has applied automatically to all
the instances which are associated with an instance. is the second layer of defense.
>>by default in security group there no deny option it will allow the traffic how you will deny the ip . in that place you can allow specific ip only
>>security-group is stateful
>>if you use security group it will be only server level only. security group only have allow the ips only

>>NACL It is the first layer of defense.
>>NACL only for subnets by default automatically creates a VPC when we create a VPC and NCL is Stateless you need to enable inbound and outbound also if you are enable inbound not 
enabled outboind it will not work and it will sit infornt of security group 
>>if you add one port in the inbound rule you need to add an ephemeral port in the outbound otherwise it won't work
>>it will applied by subnet any server is there in subnet this will apply to that server or subnet level  using NACL.NACL have allow and deny option

42-How many security groups can be attached to an EC2 instance?

>>five

43-where we can attach security groups

>>EC2
>>Load-Balancer  (all)
>>Not for subnets

44-What is the difference between NACL and Subnet ? Explain with a use case ?

>>For example, I want to design a security architecture, I would use a combination of NACLs and security groups. At the subnet level, I would configure NACLs to enforce inbound and
outbound traffic restrictions based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. NACLs are stateless and can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering traffic 
at the subnet boundary.At the instance level, I would leverage security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic. Security groups are stateful and operate at the instance level. 
By carefully defining security group rules, I can allow or deny specific traffic to and from the instances based on the application's security requirements.By combining NACLs and 
security groups, I can achieve granular security controls at both the network and instance level, providing defense-in-depth for the sensitive application.

45- What is Amazon EC2?

>>Ec2 Means elastic cloud computing where you are requesting AWS the cloud provider to give a virtual machine or virtual server which is elastic in nature this term is called 
compute that we called EC2
>> Elastic is nothing but scaled up and scaled-down any time is called elastic
ex:-Elastic cloud compute, elastic beanstalk, EKS, ECR , ECS
                                                     (or)
>>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web-based service that allows businesses to run application programs in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud.
>>Amazon Ec2 is scalble computing capacity and you can use the images to you cn launch the servers as you need. and its configure security and networking and storage
amazone ec2 helps you to scale up and down handling the requirements

46-what is AMI In AWS

>>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured image using this images to launch the virtual servers
>>AMI id is different of every region and every image
>>you can use in production mostly use already created AMIs

47-you are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

>>Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in 
your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services

48-Mention the different types of instances in  Amazon EC2 and explain its features.

>>General Purpose Instances: They are used to compute a range of workloads and aid in the allocation of processing, memory, and networking resources.
>>Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, 
machine learning inference, and various other tasks
>>Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
>>Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are 
carried out using hardware accelerators.
>>Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage

49- What do you understand by 'changing' in Amazon EC2?

>>To make limit administration easier for customers, Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch from the current 'instance count-based limitations' to the new 
'vCPU Based restrictions.' As a result, when launching a combination of instance types based on demand, utilization is measured in terms of the number of vCPUs.

50-What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

>>Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.
>>When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.
>>Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.

51-With specified private IP addresses, can an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance be launched? If so, which Amazon service makes it possible?

>>Yes. Utilizing VPC makes it possible (Virtual Private Cloud).

52-What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?

>>Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing 
trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances 
launched from your AMI.

53-What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:

Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI

54-What are Key-Pairs in AWS?

>>A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data
The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances.
The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.

55-what EBS Volumes

>>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances
>>it is permanent storage/persistance
>>it can be increased to max of 16TB you can't decreased the ebs
>>it is availble in SSD and HDD

disadvantages:-
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system and it should be same availbility zone
>>it is only for linux

advantages:-
>>you can diretly mount to the system 
>>it can shared between multiple servers and multiple availbility zones

56 - Types of EBS-Volumes

===general purpose ssd gp2
>>it is cheaper compared to provisioned iops
>>it is high speed gp2  performance
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 16000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 3IOPS          -->input/output operations per second
>>you can't change iops you should use aws given iops

===gp3
>>it is also costly to gp2
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 3000
>>Maximum IOPS 16000

====IO1 Provisioned IOPS
>>it is costly compared to gp2 
>>it is also high spped performance
>>minimum 4GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 64000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 50IOPS
>>you change iops what you want you can modify the iops details

====IO2 Provisioned IOPS
>>it is costly compared to gp2 and IO1
>>it is also high spped performance
>>minimum 4GB to you can extend volume upto 64TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 256000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 1000IOPS
>>you change iops what you want you can modify the iops details

47 -===example for iops gp2&IO1

DB requirment given by client 10TB he needs 100000 IOPs using do storage

gp2:
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
1 x 2500 = 2.5TB 7000 iops you will get 
>>estimate cost of your monthly bill ($3650.90)
>>con: max 250mb/sec

===if you need 100000iops you need to increase gp2 instance but IO1 you can get easily

IO1
2 x 5120 = 100000 iops with each volume 50000iops
requirement is fullfield  but it is costly compared to gp2

eatimate cost of monthly bill ($8558)
con:max throughput 781mb/sec

===cold HDD and optimized HDD and Magnetic (standard)

>>remaining all drives is slow and it is cheaper 
>>it is used for storage purpose or testing servers purpose
>>when you cant use data regularly then you can use this

where we can sql databese we can use ebs volumes explaining beloow

>>windows or linux we can gp2 volume
>>system databases we can gp2 volume
>>user database we can use IO1 volume
>>database transaction logs we can use IO1 volume 
>>tempDB we can use we can use instance store or standard
>>page file i virtual memory we can use instance store or standard
>>backups  we can use magnetic or standard

58 - what is Instance store

>>instance store is temporary storage data will be deleted if serevr reset
>>it cannot be increased or decreased
>>only ssd type is available
>>when you use instance storage while launching ec2 if the server restart or reset the data will be loose

59-what is EFS and what is the use case of it

>>Amazon Elastic File System is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services designed to provide scalable, 
elastic, concurrent with some restrictions, and encrypted file storage for use with both AWS cloud services and on-premises resources.
>>After you create an existing file system (EFS), you can't change its encryption setting. This means you can't modify an unencrypted 
file system to make it encrypted. Instead, you must: Create a new Amazon EFS file system with encryption turned on

uses cases:-
>>you can directly mount the system to ec2 instances
>>it is a share folder for network in a region
>>it is network file system  
>>it is unix or linux supported
>>it can shared between multiple servers and multiple regions
>>the storage limit 8PB

60-What is Amazon S3? 

S3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount
of data from anywhere.Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to 
these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance. 

>>we can store log files 
>>maximum uploading one file size upto 5TB
>>it is objeted level stoarge
>>it is global unique name
>>you can upload files 3types 1 - cli and 2 - aws console 3 - application through api or jenkins
>>mostly upload through api or applcation through
>>s3 bucket is not global why meanswhen you creating a buckrt its ask region but it will show all the regions
>>s3 availbilty is 99.9 uptime
>>s3 durability is 99.999999 it will not gone delete 
>>when you uploading a file it will save in 3 az but it will not show that saving
>>it will charge when you uploading and storage and when you accessing through internet will cost 
>>you can enable version control

---storage types
>>if frequently using data means use this (standard)
>>if we can't access frequently that's a old data we can use this (standar, glacier)
>>temporary log files you can use this (One Zone-IA)

61-S3 life-cycle

>>you can create the bucket using create the lifecycle then that will save in first 30 days standardd if not frequently accessing that you can move that data into
standard-IA then this data also not frequently using then you can move into One-Zone-IA then move to S3-glacier it is permenanent data storage for lon-term
if you want delete you can specify also after 1 or 2 or 10 years afters also

62-what is S3 Replication

>>transfer the data one bucket to another bucket
>>craete bucket anji256 on that time you should enable the replication
>>it is use gor mostly log-purpose of saving

===how to add replication
>>click on add rule >>enable version
>>select bucket anji159
>>select the storage type glacier or anything
>>click on next done
>>if you upload data in the bucket of anji256 the data will save in the bucket of anji159

63-How many S3 buckets can be created?

Up to 100 buckets can be created by default

64-s3 bucket stoarge types

1-standard
2-standard I-A
3-onezone I-A
4-S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
5-S3 glacier

65-what is Glacier

>>s3 glacier cheap storage
>>for longterm backup we can use this
>>if you stored data in glacier if retriving it  will charge it's not for regular purpose 
its for longterm
>>you can take glacier backup using third-party tools fast glacier, altro, vertias,netbackup,networker,Aavamar,Tivoli
>>glacier is called vault

66-can I store my EBS volume in s3 bucket

>>When you create an EBS snapshot, it's automatically stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that's managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can copy snapshots
within the same AWS Region, or from one Region to another. However, you can't copy snapshots to S3 buckets that you manage.

67-How can I grant a user access to a specific folder in my Amazon S3 bucket?

>>If your IAM user and s3 bucket are present in the AWS account then you can grant user access to a specific bucket folder using IAM policy

You can add the IAM policy to individual IAM users or you can attach yje IAM policy to an IAM role that multiple users can switch to.
If the IAM identity (user or role) and the s3 bucket belonging to differnet AWS accounts, then you 
must grnat access on both IAM policy and the bucket policy

68-What does bucket policy mean?

>>With Amazon S3 bucket policies, you can secure access to objects in your buckets, so that only users with the appropriate permissions can access them. 
You can even prevent authenticated users without the appropriate permissions from accessing your Amazon S3 resources.

69-can i copy my AMI into s3 bucket

>>You can store an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in an Amazon S3 bucket, copy the AMI to another S3 bucket, and then restore it from the S3 bucket.

70-what are the types of encryption in s3

>>using AWS KMS policy using create the key assign to users then it will use encrypt the data 
two types of encryptipon there AWS KMS policys

1-symatric key : same key is used encrypt and decrypt 
2-asymatric ky : differnt keys used to encrypt and decrypt

Server-side encryption – Amazon S3 encrypts your objects before saving them on disks in AWS data centers and then decrypts the objects when you download them. ...
Client-side encryption – You encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3.

71-Do you prefer to host a website on S3? What’s the reason if your answer is either yes or no?

>>Yes, it can be a good option to host a website on S3. Hosting a website on S3 is a cost-effective solution for static websites that don’t require server-side processing.
S3 is a reliable and scalable storage service that offers high availability and durability.
>>However, hosting a dynamic website with server-side processing on S3 is not recommended as it lacks the necessary compute resources and scalability to handle such websites.
In such cases, it’s better to use other AWS services like EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.

72-which is faster stoarge EBS or S3

EBS: EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. It offers low-latency, high-performance storage optimized for transactional workloads and applications
that require frequent read/write access to data. EBS volumes are typically used as primary storage for applications running on EC2 instances.

S3: S3, on the other hand, is an object storage service designed for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data. It is highly scalable and durable, offering high availability
and durability for data. S3 is accessed over the network and is well-suited for use cases such as data backup, data archiving, static website hosting, and content distribution.
>>The performance of EBS and S3 can vary based on several factors, including the storage class, instance type, network connectivity, workload characteristics, and access patterns. 
However, in general, EBS is designed for low-latency access and is optimized for performance-sensitive workloads, while S3 is optimized for scalability, durability, and cost-effectiveness
at the expense of slightly higher latency.
>>It's important to consider the specific requirements of your application or use case when choosing between EBS and S3. If your application requires low-latency access to storage and
frequent read/write operations, EBS is usually the more suitable choice. On the other hand, if you have large volumes of unstructured data, require high scalability, or need to 
store data for long-term archival purposes, S3 is a better fit.

In summary, the "faster" storage option between EBS and S3 depends on your specific workload and requirements. It is recommended to analyze your application's needs and the characteristics
of the storage services to make an informed decision.

73-Your application needs to access AWS services, such as S3 securely within your VPC. How would you achieve this?

>>To securely access AWS services within the VPC, we can use VPC endpoints. VPC endpoints allow instances in the VPC to communicate with AWS services privately, without requiring
Internet gateways or NAT gateways. 
We can create VPC endpoints for specific AWS services, such as S3 and DynamoDB, and associate them with the VPC. 
This enables secure and efficient communication between the instances in the VPC and the AWS services.

74-S3 buckets offer several advantages, including:

Durability and availability: S3 provides high durability and availability for your data.
Scalability: You can store and retrieve any amount of data without worrying about capacity constraints.
Security: S3 offers multiple security features such as encryption, access control, and audit logging.
Performance: S3 is designed to deliver high performance for data retrieval and storage operations.
Cost-effective: S3 offers cost-effective storage options and pricing models based on your usage patterns.

75-hat is S3 Event Notifications and Triggers

>>S3 event notifications allow you to configure actions when specific events occur in an S3 bucket. For example, you can trigger AWS Lambda functions, send messages to 
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), or invoke other services using Amazon SNS when an object is created or deleted.

76-you have a VPC with a public subnet and private subnet. Instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates. How would you allow internet access for
instances in the private subnet?

>>To allow internet access for instances in the private subnet, we can use an Internet gateway or a NAT instance
>> We would place the NAT Gateway/instance in the public subnet and configure the private subnet route table to send outbound traffic to the NAT Gateway/instance. This way instances 
in the private subnet can access the internet through the NAT Gateway/instance.

77-you have launched EC2 instances in your VPC, and you want them to communicate with each other using private IP addresses. What steps would you take to enable this communication?

>>By default, instances within the same VPC can communicate with each other using private IP addresses. 
To ensure this communication, we need to make sure that the instances are launched in the same VPC and are placed in the same subnet or subnets that are connected through a peering 
connection or a VPC peering link. 
Additionally, we should check the security groups associated with the instances to ensure that the necessary inbound and outbound rules are configured to allow communication between them.

78-your organization has a VPC with multiple subnets you want to restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet but allow outbound internet access for resources in 
another subnet how would achieve this?

>>To restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet we can modify the route table associated with that subnet in the route table we can remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0)
that points to an internet gateway
>>This would prevent resources in that subnet from accessing the internet for the subnet where outbound internet access is required we can keep the default route pointing to the 
Internet gateway

79-you have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application. the application needs to be highly available and scalable how would you design the VPC architecture

>> In this scenario, I would design a VPC architecture in the following way.

I would create 2 subnets public and private the public subnet would contain the load balancer and be accessible from the internet. the private subnet would host the application servers.
I would distribute the subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability. Additionally, I would configure auto-scaling groups for the application servers.

80-Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads. How would you set up this isolated environment?

>>To set up an isolated environment within the VPC, we can create a subnet with no internet gateway attached. 
>>This subnet, known as an "isolated subnet," will not have direct internet connectivity. We can place the sensitive workloads in this subnet, ensuring that they are protected from 
inbound and outbound internet traffic. 
>>However, if these workloads require outbound internet access, we can set up a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a different subnet and configure the isolated subnet's route table to
send outbound traffic through the NAT Gateway/instance.

81-You want to implement strict network access control for your VPC resources. How would you achieve this?

>>To implement granular network access control for VPC resources, we can use Network Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. We can define inbound and outbound rules in the NACLs to allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, 
ports, and protocols. 
By carefully configuring NACL rules, we can enforce fine-grained access control for traffic entering and leaving the subnets.

82-You have a private subnet in your VPC that contains a number of instances that should not have direct internet access. However, you still need to be able to securely access these 
instances for administrative purposes. How would you set up a bastion host to facilitate this access?

>>To securely access the instances in the private subnet, you can set up a bastion host (also known as a jump host or jump box). The bastion host acts as a secure entry point to your 
private subnet. Here's how you can set up a bastion host: Create a new EC2 instance in a public subnet, which will serve as the bastion host. Ensure that this instance has a public IP 
address or is associated with an Elastic IP address for persistent access. Configure the security group for the bastion host to allow inbound SSH (or RDP for Windows) traffic from your
IP address or a restricted range of trusted IP addresses. This limits access to the bastion host to authorized administrators only. Place the instances in the private subnet and configure
their security groups to allow inbound SSH (or RDP) traffic from the bastion host security group.SSH (or RDP) into the bastion host using your private key or password. From the bastion host,
you can then SSH (or RDP) into the instances in the private subnet using their private IP addresses.

83-how to encrypt the unencrypted AMI

>>A Launch Configuration is a configuration template that specifies the parameters for launching instances in an ASG. It includes details such as the EC2 instance type, AMI ID, 
security groups, key pairs, block device mappings, and user data scripts. When creating an ASG, you associate it with a Launch Configuration. If the desired capacity of the ASG changes, 
the ASG automatically creates new instances based on the Launch Configuration settings

84-How have you ensured high availability and fault tolerance for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented AWS Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups to ensure that our application could handle sudden spikes in traffic and maintain high availability.
We also set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the application and alert us in case of any failures, allowing us to quickly respond and ensure fault tolerance.

85-Can you explain a time when you had to troubleshoot an issue with an AWS application?

>>In my previous role, we had an issue with an EC2 instance not responding to incoming traffic. After reviewing the logs, we discovered that the security group rules were misconfigured,
causing the instance to reject incoming traffic. We adjusted the security group rules to allow incoming traffic, and the issue was resolved.

86-how NAT-Gateway will work

>> When we use to launch the nat-gateway in the public subnet then we can add it to private route tables

87-Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?

Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, 
developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.
>>Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS

88-What is the maximum limit of elastic IPs anyone can produce?

>>A maximum of five elastic IP addresses can be generated per location and AWS account.

89-what is a storage gateway and what types

>>AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud storage services that provide on-premises access to virtually connect the cloud storage.

>>volume-gateway:- A Volume Gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
devices from your on-premises application servers.

>>File-gateway:- File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. 
With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.

>>Tape-gateway:-Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS without 
changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on premises for low-latency data access
