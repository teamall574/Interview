1-What is Prometheus

>>prometheus is a time series database. prometheus is designed to monitor targets servers,databases, standlone virtual machines pretty much everything can be 
monitored with prometheus
>>Prometheus is an open-source linux server montoring tool mainly used for metrics montoring, event montoring, alert montoring etc
>>prometheus uses for own powerful lanaguage "promQL"
>>promotheus uses multiple modes used for graphing and dashboarding support
>>you can create the custom roles and add in prometheus rules you can see in the prometheus this will help you to end complex commands
like what the amount free size memoty and data and cpu utilization
>>like wise you can add the alrets rules also

ex:-
groups:
  - name: custom_rules
    rules:
      - record: node_memory_MemFree_percent
        export: 100*-(100 * node_memory_Memfree_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
      - record: node_filesystems_free_percents
        export:
 >>systemctl deamon-reload   -->it wil restart the deamon-sets
        
 record name will take the prometheus site or gui interface it will show the command output like how much free space or cpu utilization accroding to command
