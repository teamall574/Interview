>>we will follow this stragey build once run in any environment. 
>>we build our application in development environment we push to the artifactory nexus or jfrog artifactory. we will have configuration files differnet
environment when we deploy the applications dev environment we will apply the dev configuration file when we deploying the applications in testing environment
we will apply the test configuration files same as like production also

7-Why has DevOps become famous?
>>As we know before DevOps there are two other software development models:
Waterfall model
Agile model
In the waterfall model, we have limitations of one-way working and lack of communication with customers. This was overcome in Agile by including
the communication between the customer and the company by taking feedback. But in this model, another issue is faced regarding communication between 
the Development team and operations team due to which there is a delay in the speed of production. This is where DevOps is introduced. It bridges the 
gap between the development team and the operation team by including the automation feature. Due to this, the speed of production is increased. 
By including automation, testing is integrated into the development stage. Which resulted in finding the bugs at the very initial stage which increased 
the speed and efficiency.

8-How DevOps is helpful to developers?

>>DevOps is very helpful for developers to fix the bugs and quickly implement the new features. It also helps in more transparent communication 
between the team members.

9-Explain some popular devops tools

1-jenkins
2-Ansible

6-Kubernetes

10-What are the prerequisites for the DevOps implementation?

Proper communication between the team members.
At least one version control software.
Automated testing.
Automated deployment.

11- What are the different phases in DevOps?

Plan - Initially, there should be a plan for the type of application that needs to be developed. Getting a rough picture of the development process is always a good idea.
Code - The application is coded as per the end-user requirements. 
Build - Build the application by integrating various codes formed in the previous steps.
Test - This is the most crucial step of the application development. Test the application and rebuild, if necessary.
Integrate - Multiple codes from different programmers are integrated into one.
Deploy - Code is deployed into a cloud environment for further usage. It is ensured that any new changes do not affect the functioning of a high traffic website.
Operate - Operations are performed on the code if required.
Monitor - Application performance is monitored. Changes are made to meet the end-user requirements.

12-What are the key components of DevOps?

Continuous integration
Continuous testing
Continuous delivery
Continuous montiring

13-How is DevOps different from agile methodology?

>>DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, 
deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle. 

14-what is continous delivery and continous deployment 

>>continous delivery:- is state where your application always ready to be deployed manual  step is required to be actually deply the application

>>continous deployment:- is the automation of building testing and deploying if all test pass every commit will push new code through the entire development pipeline
to production with no manual intervention

>>continous integration:- is the automated building and testing of your application on every new commit

15 - What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?

>>the main difference between them is that continous delivery requires manual intervention to deploy.continous deployment is completely automated

16-Which scripting tools are used in DevOps?

>>Both Python and Ruby scripting tools are used in the DevOps.

17- Why open source tools boost DevOps?

>>SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It’s a framework that describes the stages involved in the development of software
Planning: In this stage, project goals and requirements are identified, and a plan is created for how the software will be developed.
Analysis: In this stage, the requirements are analyzed in more detail, and a functional specification is created.
Design: In this stage, the software design is created, including the architecture, database schema, and user interface.
Implementation: In this stage, the code is written, and the software is tested to ensure it meets the requirements.
Testing: In this stage, the software is tested to ensure it’s free of bugs and meets the requirements.
Deployment: In this stage, the software is released to the users.
Maintenance: In this stage, the software is monitored and updated to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the users.

33-Difference between agile methodologies and DevOps methodology.

and principles that emphasize collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery and deployment.
>>Team Structure: Agile teams typically consist of developers, testers, and a product owner, while DevOps teams are cross-functional, including developers, operations staff, and 
other stakeholders.
>>Release Cycle: Agile methodologies often release software in regular intervals, while DevOps aims to release software as quickly and frequently as possible through 
continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.
>>Automation: DevOps places a stronger emphasis on automation than agile methodologies, using tools like configuration management, continuous integration and deployment, 
and monitoring to improve efficiency and quality.

34-what is the shift left

>>Shift left is the practice of moving testing, quality, and performance evaluation early in the development process, often before any code is written. Shift left testing helps teams 
anticipate changes that arise during the development process that can affect performance or other delivery processes
>>In earlire day we are doing CI, Deploymnet, Testing, Scaning in our deploy production then we have tested .in Shift left process we test in devlopment stages like functional testing 
and perfformance checking and quality checking security checking
>>in shift left we start test early in SDLC
>>since requirements gathering
>>Delivering Quality software and speed 

35-what is the shift right

>>Shift right is the practice of performing testing, quality, and performance evaluation in production under real-world conditions. Shift right methods ensure that applications 
running in production can withstand real user load while ensuring the same high levels of quality.

SonarLint:
>>SonarLint is available only in the IDE (IntelliJ, Visual Studio and Eclipse).
>>Its objective is to offer immediate feedback as you enter your code.
>>It concentrates on what code you specify or modify for this function.
>>SonarLint is an agent that enables us to connect with SonarQube and executes the analysis remotely.

>>Both SonarQube and SonarLint are dependent on the same analyzers for static source code, most of which is written using SonarSource technology.

41-Is SonarQube Replacement for Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs?

>>By default, for Java projects, Sonar executes FindBugs, CheckStyle, and PMD, as well as a few other "plugins", such as Cobertura. The main advantage is that it 
stores the history in a database. Sonar uses these three tools as plugins and the data from all three of these tools is applied with a value that displays graphs.
