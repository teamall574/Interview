creating connection between two vpc

>>ip address must not be overlap

>>vpc peering don't transit. transit means mediator or green is connected to red and red is connected to Blue but Blue is not interconnected or
ping to Green you need to every vpc interconnection

>>it is one to one connection

>>real time your not giving public ips your connecting your vpn through the server

Green

>>create vpc name Green ip 10.1.1.0/24

>>create subnet name Green-subnet select vpc Green and ip 10.1.1.0/24 select aZ us-east-1a

>>create internet gateway Green-igw and attach vpc Green

>>create route name Green-route and select vpc Green and edit route add 0.0.0.0/0 and select interet gateway Green-igw

>>craete one instance using VPC Green and subnet green-sub and public ip enable and private ip 10.1.1.100 security group all key 

Red

>>create vpc name Red and ip 192.168.1.0/24

>>create subnet name Red-subnet select vpc Red and ip 192.168.1.0/24 select aZ us-east-1a

>>create internet gateway Red-igw and attach vpc Red

>>create route name Red-route and select vpc Red and edit route add 0.0.0.0/0 and select interet gateway Red-igw

>>craete one instance using VPC Red subnet Red-sub and public ip enable and private ip 192.168.1.100 security group all protocal

Blue

>>create vpc name Blue and ip 172.16.1.0/24

>>create subnet name Blue-subnet select vpc Blue and ip 172.16.1.0/24 select aZ us-east-1a

>>create internet gateway Blue-igw and attach vpc Green

>>create route name Blue-route and select vpc Blue and edit route add 0.0.0.0/0 and select interet gateway Blue-igw

>>craete one instance using VPC Blue and subnet Blue-sub and public ip enable and private ip 172.16.1.100 and security group all protocals
