>>transit gateway is chargeble

>>vpc need to connect using peering

>>if in case using mutiple vpc using environment that need multiple peerings.so that why using transit gateway

>>create 3vpc of transit gateway

>>create vpc name Green ip 10.1.0.0/16

>>create subnet Green-sub and vpc Green and ip 10.1.1.0/24

>>create internet gateway Green-igw and attach vpc Green

>>create route table Green-route and add 0.0.0.0/0 and select internet gateway

>>create vpc name blue ip 192.168.0.0/16

>>create subnet blue-sub select vpc blue and ip 192.168.1.0/24

>>create internet gateway blue-igw and select vpc blue. and attach to blue vpc 

>>create route blue-route and and add route 0.0.0.0/0 and internet gateway

>>create vpc name red ip 172.16.0.0/16

>>craete subnet red-sub select vpc red and ip 172.16.1.0/24

>>create internet gateway red-igw and select vpc red. and attach to red vpc 

>>create route red-route and and add route 0.0.0.0/0 and internet gateway

>>go to transit gateway

>>name TGW1 then ok -->it will take time mean time launch ec2-instances

>>launch instance using vpc green and subnet green-sub region us-east-1a ip 10.1.1.100 and allow all protocals name green-server

>>launch instance using vpc blue and subnet blue-sub region us-east-1a ip 192.168.1.100 and allow all protocals name blue-server

>>launch instance using vpc red and subnet red-sub region us-east-1a ip 172.16.1.100 and allow all protocals name red-server

>>try to login and ping each server you won't get ping access

>>go to transit gateway attachments and select transit gateway TGW1 and select vpc and vpc of Green and subnet green-sub1 region us-east-1a  and attach

>>go to transit gateway attachments and select transit gateway TGW1 and select vpc and vpc of blue and subnet blue-sub1 region us-east-1a  and attach

>>go to transit gateway attachments and select transit gateway TGW1 and select vpc and vpc of red and subnet red-sub1 region us-east-1a  and attach

>>go to green route table edit route add 192.168.0.0/16 and select transit gateway and edit route 172.16.0.0/16 and select transit gateway

>>go to blue route table edit route add 172.16.0.0/16 and select transit gateway and edit route 10.1.0.0/16 and select transit gateway

>>go to red route table edit route add 192.168.0.0/16 and select transit gateway and edit route 10.1.0.0/16 and select transit gateway

>>if you try ping all the three devies you will get
