>>AWS managed policies:- aws managed by this policies, you can reuse the policies
>>customer managed policies:- you can create and attach the policies to user and groups like giving permssiones and denying users or groups. you can reuse the polices
>>Inline policies:- its like same customer maneged policies but its one to one like one user or role you cant reuse the poliices it is not visible for everyone 
it is visible for only user and it is embed directly into a single user, group, or role.

98- what is IAM policy simulator?

99- what is the differnce between customer managed policy and inline policy

>>A customer managed policy is a standalone policy that you administer in your own AWS account. 
An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role).

100- where we can use roles

>>role is used manage the Accounts
>>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles are entities you create and assign specific permissions to that allow trusted identities such as workforce identities and applications
to perform actions in AWS. When your trusted identities assume IAM roles, they are granted only the permissions scoped by those IAM roles.role is not a user
>>roles is also use access-key and secret-key but will not show its automatically create that and also create the token in your system but it will be expiry in 6-8 hours then 
it will create the one more token. if you want use that credentials in without token it will not work

101-what is the difference between IAM and roles

>>The difference between IAM roles and policies in AWS is that a role is a type of IAM identity that can be authenticated and authorized to utilize an AWS resource, 
whereas a policy defines the permissions of the IAM identity.
>>A Role with no Policy attached to it won’t have to access any AWS resources.
>>A Policy that is not attached to an IAM role is effectively unused. Permissions listed in an IAM policy are only enforced when that policy is attached to an IAM identity.

102-what is Assume role

>>Assume role is nothing your giving temporary or prmenaent access another aws account user or group level access to another account.the user can access what permission your
giving that will be accessbile that user anytime briefly in below see

>>your in Anji account createing role in as anji1 role using another AWS account enter sampi AWS account number 11256 and add persmission like ec2 or s3 click on create.copy your ARN 
go to sampi account have vinod user go to policies create STS policy in that paste anji1 role ARN and create that policy. attach that policy into vinod user and login with vinod user
you can see option in support that see switch to role paste the Account number and role number you will be able to access anji1 role what the permission you have

101- what is role-switching

>>When you switch to a role, you temporarily give up your user permissions and work with the permissions that are assigned to the role. 
When you exit the role, your user permissions are automatically restored

>>your createing one role giving this access to another accounts then that account can access the your given resources this called role-switching

104-what is Service control policys

>>Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available 
permissions for all accounts in your organization.

>>simply its like an editor(vim,pycharm,sublime text,atom)with some extra features
>>it supports to run differnet languages like python,go,nodejs,java,..etc
>>it is installed or running on amazon linux server and we can access /tmp using lambda function
>>aws lambda needs server it is installed and running amazon linux but your not maintaing thats it
>>lambda execution maximum time is 15mins. maximum file size in lambda is 75gb in a region. maximum thousnd instance in a region

Requirements for AWS Lambda function:-
1-the handler is the entry point for the lambda. the lambda function accepts json formated input and will usaully return the same
2-we usually correlate directly with the language selected to write your function
3-manual trigger or rnby us you can configure a lambda invocation to an event such as upload to s3,dynamodb,API Gateway,AWS Cloudwatch

>>you can stop and start ec2-instance using python boto3 and lambda, Alerting mails if ec2 stop or start and creating EBS snapshots,copy of EBS snapshots

114-differnce between ec2 and lambda

ec2:-
1-ec2 instance how much used you should pay the bill
2-on-demand price. for example your launch one ec2 not using but you should pay the bill
3-install required software
4-user can host the complete application
5-need to update and patches user should maintain

lambda:-
1-when we runing functions on that time you should pay the bill into lambda service
2-AWS Lambad you pay only what you used . your charges based on the number of requests on your functions and duration
3-selecting only required software or runtime
4-it is just peace of code to host the code
5-no need to update the updates and maintian by aws

115-what is concurrency in lambda

>>AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want 
and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

---Advantages
>>CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, 
all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third-party resources.

---Disadvantages
>>CloudFormation uses either JSON or YAML. This makes CloudFormation easy to read and manage. But there is a constraint that doesn't allow AWS developers to 
create CloudFormation templates greater than 51MB in size. In case the template exceeds this size limit, developers need to create a nested stack for the templates.

>we can use this template to create the services we can use this code to version control and if we can modify the code we can easily undesrstand
>>aws cloud-formation uses YAML and JSON lanugauge
>>Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
>>Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template

123- if the replacement is true in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation when your are deployed one server and then changed key pair or something nything in your cloud-formation and importing in resource 
through updating when its come true means it will destroy the server or ec2-system and install fresh system or ec2 or resource.

./apachectl start

You may also use a script located in /etc/init.d/. Mostly it will be named either “apache” or “httpd”

/etc/init.d/apache stop
/etc/init.d/apache start

Another procedure would be using services

httpd stop
service httpd start

218-What is Apache Tomcat?

>>Apache Tomcat is basically a Web Server and Servlet system which is an open-source (i.e. freely available on the internet)
It is the server mostly used by Java Developers.

The server is nothing but a computer program that provides service to other computers.

There are basically two types of server:

Application Server
Web Server
Apache Tomcat offers HTTP protocol, which means the user can connect with the server from anywhere by the URL provided and can access the Java application.

This is very easy and simple to install and is compatible with any Operating System.

219-What are the types of batch file with the help of which we can Start and Stop Apache Tomcat Server?

>>There are basically two types of batch files with which we can Start and Stop the Server.

Startup.bat
Shutdown.bat

220-What are the vital benefits of Running Tomcat as service?
The benefits of Running Tomcat as service are:

>>Automatic Startup – If tomcat window service starts up automatically then it would be helpful when we want to start the system remotely.
>>Security – It allows you to execute under a special account which is protected from the other accounts.
>>Starting off the server without active user login: So even if there is no active user, the available server can be started.

221-you can configure the onliner commadns like this to start and stop

>>ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup
>>ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown

without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

225-what is first in first out

>>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues have all the capabilities of the standard queues, but are designed to enhance messaging between applications
when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated.
>>For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). 
If you reach this quota, Amazon SQS returns no error messages. A queue name can have up to 80 characters

226-what is AWS secret Manager

>>AWS Secret manager is a service for easier management of secret. Secrets can be passwords, DB Credentials API keys or any text
>>You can store and control to these secrets centrally by using one of the following

traffic or troubleshooting any connectivity issues

257-What is the relation between AMI and Instance?

>>Instances can be launched by AMIs. One AMI can launch as many instances as required. An instance type defines the hardware of the host computer including information about computers and
its memory abilities. After launching an instance, it works as a traditional host and could be interacted with as with any other computer.


259-Can you explain the steps to secure an AWS environment using IAM, VPC security groups, and network ACLs

>>Certainly! Securing an AWS environment involves multiple layers of security controls, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups, 
and network ACLs. Here are the steps to secure an AWS environment using these components:

IAM (Identity and Access Management):

Create individual IAM user accounts for each person or system that requires access to your AWS resources.
Assign appropriate IAM policies to each IAM user, granting them the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to provide an extra layer of security.
Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and remove unnecessary access.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Security Groups:

Define security groups within your VPC to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
Create separate security groups for different types of resources based on their security requirements.
Specify the inbound and outbound rules for each security group, allowing only necessary protocols, ports, and IP ranges.
Regularly review and update security group rules to ensure they align with your organization's security policies.
Avoid overly permissive rules and follow the principle of least privilege.
Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):

Network ACLs act as a firewall for controlling traffic at the subnet level within your VPC.
Define inbound and outbound rules in network ACLs to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
Carefully evaluate and configure network ACLs to restrict access to your resources.
Regularly review and update network ACL rules as per your security requirements.

261-what is SLA(service-level agreement)

>>They provide information on all contracted services and on the agreed expected reliability and they clearly set out the parameters, responsibilities and expectations 
so that in the event of a problem with the service, no party can plead ignorance

265-what is CFT template/how a resource depends on other resourcce

>>A CFT (CloudFormation Template) is a JSON or YAML file used to describe and provision AWS resources in a repeatable and automated manner. It allows you to define your 
infrastructure as code, specifying the desired state of your AWS resources and their relationships.In a CloudFormation template, you define a collection of AWS resources, their properties,
and the relationships between them. This includes specifying dependencies between resources, which ensures that resources are created and configured in the correct order.

Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-bucket

  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-12345678
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      KeyName: my-key-pair
      DependsOn: MyS3Bucket

270-what is the full of form WAR file

>>Web Archive File 

283-What is the difference between IAM users, groups, roles and policies ?

>>IAM User: An IAM user is an identity within AWS that represents an individual or application needing access to AWS resources. IAM users have permanent long-term credentials, such as
a username and password, or access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key). IAM users can be assigned directly to IAM policies or added to IAM groups for easier management of permissions.
>>IAM Role: An IAM role is similar to an IAM user but is not associated with a specific individual. Instead, it is assumed by entities such as IAM users, applications, or services to 
obtain temporary security credentials. IAM roles are useful when you want to grant permissions to entities that are external to your AWS account or when you want to delegate access to 
AWS resources across accounts. IAM roles have policies attached to them that define the permissions granted when the role is assumed.
>>IAM Group: An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. By organizing IAM users into groups, you can manage permissions collectively. IAM groups make it easier to assign permissions 
to multiple users simultaneously. Users within an IAM group inherit the permissions assigned to that group. For example, you can create a "Developers" group and assign appropriate 
policies to grant permissions required for developers across your organization.
>>IAM Policy: An IAM policy is a document that defines permissions and access controls in AWS. IAM policies can be attached to IAM users, IAM roles, and IAM groups to define what actions 
can be performed on which AWS resources. IAM policies use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) syntax to specify the permissions and can be created and managed independently of the users, 
roles, or groups. IAM policies consist of statements that include the actions allowed or denied, the resources on which the actions can be performed, and any additionalconditions.

287-what is AWS API-Gateway

>>Amazon API-Gateway is a fully-managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, montiro, and secure APIs at any Scale
>>APIs acts as the "front-door" for applications to access data business logic or functionality from your backend services
>>API-Gateway helps us to create a RESTful APIs and Web-Socket APIs that enable real-time two-way communcication

291-what is CORS and SOP

--sop->same origin policy
>>The same-origin policy is a browser security mechanism that restricts how a
document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another
origin.
It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors
>>the browser will implement the sop in all browser beacuse of security
>>this implemnentation happiens we can't see the data of your own subdomain also
>>it checks the three objects
>>protocal >https:// (or) http://
>>site >google (or) facebook
>>port number >80 (or) 443
--cors->cros origin resource policy
>>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that
allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port)
other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
Acess-control-allow-origin==>true,get,post,put,delete
>>the sop implmented in browser policy we cant read the data in your subdomain of
the same domian.
if we can use the cors we can read write the data from main domain to subdomain
>http://www.google.com
>http://admin.google.com

292-where security comes in 

>>when we build the application then it go the qa team and test then it any changes happen then it will take the build then go the security testing and then deployment

what precautions would take the security of your application

>>we can build the feature development then security testing then sends to qa testing and then security testing then releasing the production
>>detecting issues early shortens development time

why security issues comes into production what bases it will come

1-time restrictions:- need to relase the relases within a week without checking the secuity issues deploy application into production
2-hard to get answers:- where the problems hard to find out the issues need to clarify with the developers to take understand the issues
3-unfamiliar with pipelines 

293-what is SAST

>>SAST stands for Static application security testing and its one of the easier types of security testing to implement in an existing or a new DevOps or DevSecOps pipeline
>>SAST tools run somewhere between the code and build stage, may be it'll be included in the test satge, but typically it's run pretty close to the code 
>>SAST we're thinking of statically testing the application. SAST is also known as Source Code Analysis 
>>it is white-box testing it cheks all the packages in your code it has 
>>it may false reports also some time
>>less expensive to fix the vulnerabilites 
>>it check differnet authentication patterns and scan config files potential security issues 
Tools like:-
1-sonarqube
2-Fortify.
3-Horusec
4-Snyk
5-Insider
6-HuskyCI

294-what is DAST

>>DAST stands for Dynamic application security testing. we check the application while running application for an issues . we are not loooking code directly
>>DAST is block box testing the tester dont know anything try to break the code or application logics 
>>more expensive to fix the vulnerabilites
>>we can discover run-time environment related issues
Tools:-
1-PortSwigger Burp-Suite
2-OWASP-ZAP
3-Veracode
4-Nuclei
5-HCL AppScan

295-what is Fortify security tool
