allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port)
other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
Acess-control-allow-origin==>true,get,post,put,delete
>>the sop implmented in browser policy we cant read the data in your subdomain of
the same domian.

>>detecting issues early shortens development time

why security issues comes into production what bases it will come

1-time restrictions:- need to relase the relases within a week without checking the secuity issues deploy application into production
2-hard to get answers:- where the problems hard to find out the issues need to clarify with the developers to take understand the issues
3-unfamiliar with pipelines 

293-what is SAST

>>SAST tools run somewhere between the code and build stage, may be it'll be included in the test satge, but typically it's run pretty close to the code 
>>SAST we're thinking of statically testing the application. SAST is also known as Source Code Analysis 
>>it is white-box testing it cheks all the packages in your code it has 
>>it may false reports also some time
>>less expensive to fix the vulnerabilites 
>>it check differnet authentication patterns and scan config files potential security issues

1-sonarqube
2-Fortify.
3-Horusec
4-Snyk
5-Insider
6-HuskyCI
