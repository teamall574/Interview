34 - What are the tools and techniques that you can use in AWS to identify if you are paying more than you should be, and how to correct it?

Check the Top Services Table
It is a dashboard in the cost management console that shows you the top five most used services. This will let you know how much money you are 
spending on the resources in question.Cost Explorer
There are cost explorer services available that will help you to view and analyze your usage costs for the last 13 months. You can also get a cost
forecast for the upcoming three months.AWS Budgets
This allows you to plan a budget for the services. Also, it will enable you to check if the current plan meets your budget and the details of how you 
use the services.Cost Allocation Tags
This helps in identifying the resource that has cost more in a particular month. It lets you organize your resources and cost allocation tags to keep 
track of your AWS costs.

>>ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown         -->this soft link or symbalic link
>>ln /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown   -->this hard link
>>tomcatup    -->it will start the server
