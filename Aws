NETWORK-------------------------------

1 - what is IAAS

>>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is also known as Hardware as a service. the cloud provider provides the Infrastructure to the developers
like network, storage, virtualization,servers can managed by cloud provider
>>this not physical things.it will provide only infrastructure. like vms,compute,memory,OS,network,storage,firewall. things you have full control on virtual machines
ex:- Virtual machines 

>>users are managed by operating system and middle ware, runtime data application all are managed by developers
>>by using IAAS to develop the application is very hard by compared to PAAS
Advantages:-
1-controling is high because you controlled
2-cost saving
3-scalibility. 
4-faster time to market
5-expand as you grow
6-tight security
7-anytime any where access
Disadvantages:-
1-no internet no work
2-privacy is limited
3-virtualization depend

2 - what PAAS
 
>>this not physical things.the PAAS will give platform for your application. for example you have an appliation or java or dot net application
there is no database person in your team you can ask the cloud service provide he will give the database and mantainance. things you dont have full control 
on virtual machines
>>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and 
operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.

>>the disadvantage you can't customize the things in you can't troubleshoot and changes you can trade-off or compromise. you can customize but limited things only
ex:- Azure sql and App-service it is managed by the Azure you can't control anything
  
3 - what is SAAS

>>this not physical things. it is readmade product. like office 365 or google apps or salesforce .it will give full software service. its controling on you 
it is very limited 
>>SAAS is pre-existed application that applications are accessible through internet connection and web-browsers 
like google chrome, gmail, mozila browser, salesforce
 
4 - Define and explain the three basic types of cloud services and the AWS products that are built based on them?

--The three basic types of cloud services are:

>>Computing: - These include EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Auto-Scaling, and Lightsail.
>>Storage - These include S3-simple service storage, Glacier, Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System.
>>Networking - These include VPC, Amazon CloudFront, Route53

5 - what is virtualization

>>Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, 
storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs)

6 - What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?

>>Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is a fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separate from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record 
in the root block device of your image.
>>Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
>>Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.

7 - Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific

>>AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront

8 - what is VPC

>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security. 

>>it is a region dependent
>>Vpc is logical boundary
>>vpc id is globally uniqe
>>you can stop the particular ip one ec2 to another ip through routing table in peering
 
9 - What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

>>AWS regions are separate geographical areas, like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai). On the other hand, availability zones
are the areas that are present inside the regions. These are generally isolated zones that can replicate themselves whenever required.
>>The AWS Cloud spans 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions
>>20 per Region you can request need more
>>ou can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. If you need more buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a 
maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.

10  - what is VPC Perrring

>>A VPC peering  is a networking connection between two VPCs or two differnet networks. that enables you to route traffic between 
two differnt networks or two vpcs. once perring comleted they can communicate each other as if they are within the same network

>>there is no charges in vpc perring
>>you can also create the vpc peering one region mumbai to another region ohio like this
>>you can also vpc peering one account to another account

===disadvantages of peering

>>increase in the vpc will increase in the vpc peerings
>>each vpc needs a vpg for vpn connections

11 -what is nat-gateway

>>A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. it is used in private system to connect over the internet to take patches or update 
nat gateway is intellignet device using source destination packets. it will send only traffic through the public instance but not allow outside the 
traffic to your private instances.when you enabling nat gateway you must select the public subnet not the private subnet
 
12 - what is NAT-Instance

>>NAT-A NAT (Network Address Translation) instance is, like same nat-instance gateway but the differnce is the amount is big is nat gateway when compared
to nat instance

13 - What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?
 
NAT-Gateway
1 - nat gateway managed by aws 
2 - nat gateway canot assigned security groups
3 - nat gateway highly availble
4 - nat gateway bandwidth is upto 45 mbps
5 - nat gateway perfomance is good

NAT-Instance
1 - nat instance managed by you
2 - nat instance can assignes security groups
3 - nat instance is also highly availble
4 - nat instance bandwidth is depends on instnace bandwidth
5 - nat instance performance compared to nat gateway is average

14 - what is Vpc End-point

>>A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services. instance in your vpc do not require public ip
address to communicate the aws resources
 
15 - what is gateway 

>>A gateway refers to a network component that acts as an entry or exit point for traffic entering or leaving a cloud environment. It serves as a bridge between different networks or 
systems and enables communication and data transfer between them. Gateways can be used for various purposes, such as security, monitoring, load balancing, and routing. Examples of 
cloud gateways include API gateways, database gateways, and messaging gateways.

gateawy is hardware device that gives you entry and exit point in your network
>>gateway end-point is a gateway that you specific as a target for a route in your table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service

16 - what is firewall

>>firewall is allow or disallow the traffic in your network
>>firewall is security group it is used to control the incoming and outgoing traffic

>>firewall are two types

1 - stateless
>>it is not two-way handshake
>>Stateless firewalls make use of a data packet's source, destination, and other parameters to figure out whether the data presents a threat. These parameters have to be entered by either an administrator or the manufacturer via rules they set beforehand

2 - stateful firewall
>>it is two-way handshake  process
>>A stateful firewall inspects everything inside data packets, the characteristics of the data, and its channels of communication. Stateful firewalls examine the behavior of data packets, and if anything seems off, they can filter out the suspicious data. Also, a stateful firewall can track how the data behaves, cataloging patterns of behavior. 

>>it is used to allow the one side no need to allow other side it will remeber and send the packets
>>stateful firewall remebers the connection details it will give replay

3 - In-Bound rule

>> Inbound firewall rules protect the network against incoming traffic, such as disallowed connections, malware, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

4 - Out-Bound rule

>>Outbound firewall rules protect against outgoing traffic, originating inside a network.

17 - what is NACL

>>A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

>>when you created vpc automatically create nacl 
>>if anyone want say to change something nacl first ask send a mail 
>>don't do changes in nacl in production environment
>>need to add every rule in inbound and outbound  -->if you add ssh in inbound it will not allow so you need to add outbound also

18 - waht is virtual private gateway

>>A virtual private gateway is a tool establishig a safe connection or tonnel to connect over the Internet . it will create secure connection over the
Internet and it reliable. virtual network gateway is to connect your on-premises network with VPC
>>A virtual private gateway is a tool for establishing a safe tunnel to connect and transport encrypted data between devices, the cloud, and enterprise servers
across the internet. Use a virtual private gateway to create a VPN connection that is both secure and reliable.
 
19- What is site-to-site-vpn

>>A site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) is a connection between two or more networks, such as a corporate network and a branch office network. 
the site-to-site-vpn create a tonnel to connecting the secure way over the ineternet
Many organizations use site-to-site VPNs to leverage an internet connection for private traffic as an alternative to using private MPLS circuits
>>it will give two ips you can create the two tonnles if first one fails then you can use or set second one 
>>tonnel is nothing but connecting the secure way in the ineternet

20-What is point-to-site VPN?

>>A Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection lets you create a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer.
A P2S connection is established by starting it from the client computer.
>>you launch public and private certificates in your system and connect to the aws VPCS

21- what is client vpn-endpoint

>>AWS Client VPN is a fully-managed remote access VPN solution used by your remote workforce to securely access resources within both AWS and your on-premises network. 
Fully elastic, it automatically scales up, or down, based on demand

22-what is direct connect in aws

>>direct connect is like vpn but it like leased line or dedicted line to internet . you can create your virtual private network then you can connect your
aws to your on-premises. AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections between your internet 
and Amazon VPC. it is compared to vpn it is costly
>>AWS Direct Connect is a networking service that provides an alternative to using the internet to connect to AWS.

23 - What is OpenVPN used for?

>>Open source OpenVPN uses VPN technologies to secure and encrypt data sent over the internet. Its custom VPN protocol uses SSL/TLS for key exchange. 
Since its creation in 2001 it has become the de facto standard in the open source networking space with over 60 million downloads 
 
24- What is a transit gateway?

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring, in vpc perring if we created 3 or more vpc we need interconnect using vpc perring if we increase vpc perring its
diffcult to identify the traffic and get confused invpc perring. so that we using transit gateway we create one transit gateway we can interconnect the
vpc in a region its easy to understand easy to use. we can interconnect differnt region also easy way. but it is chargble

>>Transit gateway advance layer of vpc perring. the transit gateway simplifies your network connection and puts an end to complex peering relationships.
Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud router—each new connection is made only once

25 - Is there any other alternative tool to log into the cloud environment other than console?

Putty
AWS CLI for Linux
AWS CLI for Windows
AWS CLI for Windows CMD
AWS SDK
Eclipse

26 - what is operating system

>>it is an user interface between user and hardware is called operating system

27 - What is Amazon EC2?

>>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web-based service that allows businesses to run application programs in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud.
>>Amazon Ec2 is scalble computing capacity and you can use the images to you cn launch the servers as you need. and its configure security and networking and storage
amazone ec2 helps you to scale up and down handling the requirments 

28 - what is AMI In AWS

>>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured image using this images to launch the virtual servers
>>AMI id is different of every region and every image
>>you can use in production mostly use already created AMIs

29 - You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

>>Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don’t see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn’t been published in 
your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services

30 - what is authentication and authriozation

>>authentication your accessing or login into the applicatio or portal entry only
>>authrozation is nothing but you should be assign some roles are features

31 - Mention the different types of instances in  Amazon EC2 and explain its features.

>>General Purpose Instances: They are used to compute a range of workloads and aid in the allocation of processing, memory, and networking resources.
>>Compute Optimized Instances: These are ideal for compute-intensive applications. They can handle  batch processing workloads, high-performance web servers, 
machine learning inference, and various other tasks
>>Memory Optimized: They process workloads that handle massive datasets in memory and deliver them quickly.
>>Accelerated Computing: It aids in the execution of floating-point number calculations, data pattern matching, and graphics processing. These functions are 
carried out using hardware accelerators.
>>Storage Optimised: They handle tasks that require sequential read and write access to big data sets on local storage

32 - What do you understand by 'changing' in Amazon EC2?

>>To make limit administration easier for customers, Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch from the current 'instance count-based limitations' to the new 
'vCPU Based restrictions.' As a result, when launching a combination of instance types based on demand, utilization is measured in terms of the number of vCPUs.

33 - How do you upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime?

>>You can upgrade or downgrade a system with near-zero downtime using the following steps of migration:

Open EC2 console
Choose Operating System AMI
Launch an instance with the new instance type
Install all the updates
Install applications
Test the instance to see if it’s working
If working, deploy the new instance and replace the older instance
Once it’s deployed, you can upgrade or downgrade the system with near-zero downtime.

34 - What are the tools and techniques that you can use in AWS to identify if you are paying more than you should be, and how to correct it?

Check the Top Services Table
It is a dashboard in the cost management console that shows you the top five most used services. This will let you know how much money you are 
spending on the resources in question.Cost Explorer
There are cost explorer services available that will help you to view and analyze your usage costs for the last 13 months. You can also get a cost
forecast for the upcoming three months.AWS Budgets
This allows you to plan a budget for the services. Also, it will enable you to check if the current plan meets your budget and the details of how you 
use the services.Cost Allocation Tags
This helps in identifying the resource that has cost more in a particular month. It lets you organize your resources and cost allocation tags to keep 
track of your AWS costs.

35 -  What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

>>Spot instances are unused EC2 instances that users can use at a reduced cost.
>>When you use on-demand instances, you must pay for computing resources without making long-term obligations.
>>Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow you to specify attributes such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions and capacity reservations when instances in certain availability zones are used.

36 -Define Snapshots in Amazon Lightsail?

>>A snapshot is a base feature for creating backups of your EBS volumes. A snapshot takes a copy of the EBS volume and places it in Amazon S3, where it is 
stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones. The initial snapshot is a full copy of the volume; ongoing snapshots store incremental block-level changes only
>>and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts, and improve backup compliance

37 - How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?

>>Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:

State changes in Amazon EC2
Auto-scaling lifecycle events
Scheduled events
AWS API calls
Console sign-in events
amazon cloud watch

38 - With specified private IP addresses, can an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance be launched? If so, which Amazon service makes it possible?

>>Yes. Utilizing VPC makes it possible (Virtual Private Cloud).

39 - What is an Elastic Transcoder?

>>You can use Amazon Elastic Transcoder to convert video and audio files into supported output formats optimized for playback on desktops, mobile devices,
tablets, and televisions

40 - On an EC2 instance, an application of yours is active. Once the CPU usage on your instance hits 80%, you must reduce the load on it.What strategy do you 
use to complete the task?

>>It can be accomplished by setting up an autoscaling group to deploy additional instances, when an EC2 instance's CPU use surpasses 80% and by
allocating traffic across instances via the creation of an application load balancer and the designation of EC2 instances as target instances.

41 - What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?
The three types of EC2 instances are:

On-demand Instance
It is cheap for a short time but not when taken for the long term
Spot Instance
It is less expensive than the on-demand instance and can be bought through bidding. 
Reserved Instance
If you are planning to use an instance for a year or more, then this is the right one for you

42 - What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?

>>Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing 
trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances 
launched from your AMI.

43 - What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:

Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI

44 - What are Key-Pairs in AWS?

>>A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data
The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances.
The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.

45 - what EBS Volumes

>>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances
>>it is permanent storage/persistance
>>it can be increased to max of 16TB you can't decreased the ebs
>>it is availble in SSD and HDD

disadvantages:-
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system
>>ebs volume you can apply only one ec2 system and it should be same availbility zone
>>it is only for linux

advantages:-
>>you can diretly mount to the system 
>>it can shared between multiple servers and multiple availbility zones

46 - Types of EBS-Volumes

>>it is cheaper compared to provisioned iops
>>it is high speed gp2  performance
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB
>>Minimum IOPS 100
>>Maximum IOPS 16000
>>if you taken 1GB you will get 3IOPS          -->input/output operations per second
>>you can't change iops you should use aws given iops

===gp3
>>it is also costly to gp2
>>minimum 1GB to you can extend volume upto 16TB

>>if you taken 1GB you will get 1000IOPS
>>you change iops what you want you can modify the iops details

47 -===example for iops gp2&IO1

DB requirment given by client 10TB he needs 100000 IOPs using do storage

gp2:
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
2 x 5120 = 10TB  30720 iops you will get
1 x 2500 = 2.5TB 7000 iops you will get 
>>estimate cost of your monthly bill ($3650.90)
>>con: max 250mb/sec

===if you need 100000iops you need to increase gp2 instance but IO1 you can get easily

IO1
2 x 5120 = 100000 iops with each volume 50000iops
requirment is fullfield  but it is costly compared to gp2

eatimate cost of monthly bill ($8558)
con:max throughput 781mb/sec

===cold HDD and optimized HDD and Magnetic (standard)

>>remaining all drives is slow and it is cheaper 
>>it is used for storage purpose or testing servers purpose
>>when you cant use data regularly then you can use this

where we can sql databese we can use ebs volumes explaining beloow

>>windows or linux we can gp2 volume

>>user database we can use IO1 volume
>>database transaction logs we can use IO1 volume 
>>tempDB we can use we can use instance store or standard
>>page file i virtual memory we can use instance store or standard
>>backups  we can use magnetic or standard

48 - what is Instance store

>>instance store is temporary storage data will be deleted if serevr reset
>>it cannot be increased or decreased
>>only ssd type is available
>>when you use instance storage while launching ec2 if the server restart or reset the data will be loose

49 - what is Glacier

>>s3 glacier cheap storage
>>for longterm backup we can use this
>>if you stored data in glacier if retriving it  will charge it's not for regular purpose 
its for longterm
>>you can take glacier backup using third-party tools fast glacier, altro, vertias,netbackup,networker,Aavamar,Tivoli
>>glacier is called vault

50 - what is EFS and what is the use case of it

>>Amazon Elastic File System is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services designed to provide scalable, 
elastic, concurrent with some restrictions, and encrypted file storage for use with both AWS cloud services and on-premises resources.
>>After you create an existing file system (EFS), you can't change its encryption setting. This means you can't modify an unencrypted 
file system to make it encrypted. Instead, you must: Create a new Amazon EFS file system with encryption turned on

uses cases:-
>>you can directly mount the system to ec2 instances
>>it is a share folder for network in a region
>>it is network file system  
>>it is unix or linux supported
>>it can shared between multiple servers and multiple regions
>>the storage limit 8PB

51 - What is Amazon S3? 

S3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount
of data from anywhere.Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to 
these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance. 

>>we can store log files 
>>maximum uploading one file size upto 5TB
>>it is objeted level stoarge
>>it is global unique name
>>you can upload files 3types 1 - cli and 2 - aws console 3 - application through api or jenkins
>>mostly upload through api or applcation through
>>s3 bucket is not global why meanswhen you creating a buckrt its ask region but it will show all the regions
>>s3 availbilty is 99.9 uptime
>>s3 durability is 99.999999 it will not gone delete 
>>when you uploading a file it will save in 3 az but it will not show that saving
>>it will charge when you uploading and storage and when you accessing through internet will cost 
>>you can enable version control

---storage types
>>if frequently using data means use this (standard)
>>if we can't access frequently that's a old data we can use this (standar, glacier)
>>temporary log files you can use this (One Zone-IA)

53-S3 life-cycle

>>you can create the bucket using create the lifecycle then that will save in first 30 days standardd if not frequently accessing that you can move that data into
standard-IA then this data also not frequently using then you can move into One-Zone-IA then move to S3-glacier it is permenanent data storage for lon-term
if you want delete you can specify also after 1 or 2 or 10 years afters also


52 - what is S3 Replication

>>transfer the data one bucket to another bucket
>>craete bucket anji256 on that time you should enable the replication
>>it is use gor mostly log-purpose of saving

===how to add replication
>>click on add rule >>enable version
>>select bucket anji159
>>select the storage type glacier or anything
>>click on next done
>>if you upload data in the bucket of anji256 the data will save in the bucket of anji159

53 - Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?

Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, 
developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS

54 - How many S3 buckets can be created?

Up to 100 buckets can be created by default

55 - What is the maximum limit of elastic IPs anyone can produce?

A maximum of five elastic IP addresses can be generated per location and AWS account.

56 - what is storage gateway and types

>>AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud storage services that provide on-premises access to virtually connect the cloud storage.

>>volume-gateway:- A Volume Gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
devices from your on-premises application servers.

>>File-gateway:- File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. 
With S3 File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.

>>Tape-gateway:-Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS without 
changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on premises for low-latency data access

57 -  what is AWS Backup

>>AWS Backup is like snapshots. in every organzation need to take backup some of the particular resources with using of aws backup take some of major 
resources in aws backup automatically or daily backup
>>your specify the some of the resource in aws to take backup on AWS Backup service. on which time you need . you can take partcular time take backup between
partcular  resource to take the backup. its nothing but snapshots

what is backup vault
>>its like glacier vault where we can storing data or saving the data is called backup vault

58 - how many types of backup

>>two types
1-automatic
two types
a-daily backup
b-transactionlogs
2-snapshots

two types of RDS backup 

1-Automated backups:- it will store in s3
>>RDS automatically create backs up your database and transaction logs
>>RDS automcatically create a storage volumes snapshots of your DB instances backuing up the entire DB intsance
>>Automated backups occur daily during the preferred nackup window
>>Automated backups are kept for the Backup Retention period (0 to35 Days)
>>you can restore the DB instances to specify point in time during the bcakup retention period
creating a new DB instances

2-Databse snapshots

>>Database snapshots are user-initiated backups of the DB instance stored in s3
>>DB snapshots are kept intil explicitly delete them
>>you cna creae a DB instance by restoring from DB snapshots
>>the first snapshots contains the data for the full DB instance subsequent snapshots of the
same DBinstance are incremenetl
>>ypu can copy a sanpshot in the same region acrss regions and across acounts
>>you can directly resore a DB instance from unencrypted a shared snapshot

59 - how many days take AWS-backup can retrive

>>minimum 35 days

60 - what is Route53 and what is the uses

>>Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web servic. Rout53 using we can host the domians.Route53 is global. 
route53 using you can do one region to another region load balancing.route53 using you can do multiple region load-balancing.  
>>we use mostly routing policys simple, latency, falover, weighted

1-failover :- if we create two load balancer in differnt regions and create the helath checks in route 53 if we selectd the failover routing policy then we can 
create the same name of the website like www.anji.com is primary in mumbai region and www.anji.com is secondary in us-east-1 .whenever primary fails 
it will go secondary directly without checking the pings

2-weighted :- if we create weighted route policy route 53 it is like failover but the thing is you can mention the traffic which load balancer need to 
accessing the apllication over internet if we give 0 menas you can't access the application on that load balancer if we give 255 then we can access the 
loab balancer. the use case is we want maintaines on particular region you can diver the traffic into sepearte the specific load balancer

3-latency:- latency is used same is the previous failover or weighted routing policy the differnt is you can mention to the particular in region if any one 
near by india that user will connect to the india based load balancer and if any us then that user will connect the us load balancer its region based. 
it is used to decrease the latency in your application to the users

what is traffic policies in route53
>>it will give the graphical representaion of dns records

61-What is the difference between AWS latency-based routing and geo DNS

Amazon maps-out typical latency between IP addresses and AWS regions. Choose Latency-based Routing to have the fastest response. Geolocation maps the IP addresses to geographic locations. 
This permits rules like "send all users from Côte d'Ivoire to the website in France", so they see a language-specific version

62-What is dns how it works

>DNS used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol
>>dns transfers human readble domain names for (example www.amazon.com)to machine  readble to ip address for example (192.168.0.24)
>>in your real time your isp will give dns address
>>most orgnazation disable ping to stop the ddos attacks by hackers
>>rembering name is easy but number are diffcult that we using dns names

63- what is hostname resolution 

>>HostName resolution is the process of associating names and IP addresses, and it's one of the most essential services on a network. 
People understand descriptive names, but network communications require difficult-to-remember addresses

64--what is cloudwatch

>>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, hybrid, 
and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources and also analyze the logs by using iam role
 
1-cpu Utilzation
2-Memory utilization
3-harddisk
4-application montoring

2-types of montoring in AWS-Cloudwatch

1-Basic Montoring
>>it comes by default
>>it is free of cost
>>every five minutes logs will updated 

2-Deatiled montoring
>>you need enable 
>>and its not free of cost
>>every one minute logs will updated 

65-where we can use cloudwatch mostly in AWS

1-Auto-scaling --scaling policies

66-What is an AWS CloudWatch Alarm?

>>An AWS CloudWatch Alarm is a monitoring and management solution for AWS resources. It enables the configuration of alarms based on individual indicators or as part of a larger monitoring plan.
>>you can set the alarm you set sns then it whenever it will trigger you will get an notification
>>you can also billing to the alarm like if we bill some amount then it will trigger 

67-types of alarm in cloudwatch 

1-Ok -The metric is below the threshold
2-Insuffiecnt data -Not enough data available for the metric to determine the alarm state.
3-ALARM — When the metric crosses the threshold.

68-What are Cloudwatch Logs?

>>CloudWatch Logs is a tool that helps us monitor and troubleshoot our systems and applications. It uses our already-established systems, applications, and custom log files. 
In addition, it allows us to monitor our logs in real-time for particular phrases, values, or patterns.

69-How Long Do Cloudwatch Logs Store My Data?

>>Your information will be kept in Cloudwatch Logs for up to 7 days. After that point, only the most current logs will be kept, with older ones automatically deleted to save space.

70-hat is the AWS CloudWatch Agent?

>>The AWS CloudWatch Agent is software that can be deployed to any server, whether hosted on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, or on-premises. Using the AWS CloudWatch Agent, you can quickly gather 
and send system-level performance information from specific AWS resources.

71-What are three things you can do in CloudWatch?

>>Real-time monitoring is available for AWS resources and apps.
>>Create alerts that will respond automatically to changes in your AWS resources.
>>AWS CloudWatch Logs allows you to see and search log data.

72-What Types Of Cloudwatch Alarms Can Be Created?

>>Any CloudWatch measure can be displayed via an alarm you set up. You can also set off an alert based on metrics specific to your application or system.

73-What Actions Can We Take From a Cloudwatch Alarm?

Share an email with the team.
Schedule a Cron task to run.
Share on Slack or HipChat.
Run a script on this machine, such as one that imports data into a spreadsheet.

74-What Types Of Cloudwatch Alarms Can Be Created?

A warning about a specific resource (e.g., a virtual machine).
A regular notification for a specific metric (e.g., CPU usage).
A user-defined alarm (for example, if your application runs slowly, the alarm will trigger when the CPU reaches 80% and notify you immediately).
A personalized alarm based on user-defined rules.

75-Can I Retrieve Data from a Deleted ELB or Ec2 Instance?

>>Metrics data for deleted ELBs and decommissioned EC2 instances are still available. MetricsData associated with a terminated instance will be removed when the Instance is shut down. 
In contrast, MetricsData associated with your account will remain on the MetricInfraService until you delete it. This information can be used for diagnosing problems with your ECS cluster or ELB.

76-If I disable monitoring for an Ec2 instance, will I lose the metrics data?

>>No, the metrics data will not be lost.
>>If you disable monitoring for an EC2 instance, the metrics you've collected are still safely preserved in a SQL database as part of the AWS CloudTrail logs.

77-What Statistics Can I View And Graph In Cloudwatch?

Disk I/O Activity
Memory Share 
CPU Usage
Memory Usage
Network Interface Usage.

78-What is the data retention period in CloudWatch?

>>You can change the log data retention setting for CloudWatch logs. By default, logs are kept indefinitely and never expire. You can adjust the retention policy for each log group, 
keeping the indefinite retention, or choosing a retention period between 10 years and one day.

79-What is the difference between CloudWatch and CloudTrail?

>>CloudWatch is a tool provided by Amazon Web Services that monitors and reports on the performance of various AWS resources and services.
>>CloudTrail, on the other hand, is a log of all actions in your AWS environment since it was first launched.

80-What is CloudWatch events used for?

>>Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. 
Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams.

81-What services can be used to create a centralized logging solution?

>>The essential services that you can use are Amazon CloudWatch Logs, store them in Amazon S3, and then use Amazon Elastic Search to visualize them.
You can use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to move the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon ElasticSearch.
>>if your service is stopped are anything happen you can create a rule to trigger your script and send the notifications
(like if your lamabda function to stop the start and specific time then youy can use the rules it will be changed)

82-What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?

>>Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others.
Let’s take a look at two services in specific:

1-AWS CloudTrail:
>>cloudtrail is used to see th login logut details and activitesits not give detailed information
>>cloudtrail is data will save only 90 days, so we can import that into aws s3 or any centrailzied locations

2-AWS Config:
>>first enable select the resource what you need the resource type and enable recording on 
>>AWS config is used to track the details of what you changed on your instances or modfied your instances.  if you chnaged something in your ec2-instances 
it will automatically shows what you updated in your system it will and it will save in until 7 years

>>AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration 
change notifications to enable security and governance.

83- What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?

>>Distributed denial of service DDOS the main intention is to making unavilable over thr internet in a website or some resources. the hacker send the multiple
requests into website is going unavailble over the internet

AWS Shield
AWS WAF
Amazon Route53
Amazon CloudFront
ELB
VPC

84- What is CDN and how it works?

>>A CDN or cloud-front is same. content deliver network is decrese the latency in your website and it provide the cache server in all edge locations 
on your website.it is used to speedup your website over the internet

85- what is AWS Service Catalog

>>AWS Service Catalog is like menu what you want give the resources to your users you give that images or cloud-formation templates or anything specfiy the 
role to aws service catalog then it give the permisssions to that user. it will use in big environments like so many developers or there you can specif the role 
to access the particular only one cloud-formation template you can specify that using AWS service catalog

86- what is AWS SSM

>>service manager is  configuration management tool. we can use deployment and like ansible. we need ssm agnet then we can do deployment without ssm agent
we can't do anything. ssm agent is like role add to ec2-instance then we can patches and updates over the deployment and configure the resoures

87- What is load balancer and how it works? and types of load balancer

>>A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests 
in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. 
>>load balancer is region dependent
>>you can add multiple target groups into load balancer

1- Network load balancer
>>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer whenever the first system not availble then distributes incoming traffic across
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.
>>it is an layer 4 in transpot layer 
>>it is use TCP and UDP protocals
>>direct traffic based on ip address
>>you can add multiple target groups into load balancer
>>Network, or Layer 4, load balancers can provide faster responses,
>>the deregistation delay is 300 seconds
>>it will check every 30 seconds for health checks if you cant reach the server then decalre as not reachable then forward the request to another server
>>if you use one port or listner like 80 you can't use that port onemore time
>>you can save your load balancer logs in s3 
>>it will support path based routing but you need to every time differnt ports or different listners everytime
>>it is region dependent
>>by default cross-zone load balancer is not-enabled you should enable if the required happens
>>it is suitable for single application or easy application

---What is an internal load balancer?
>>An internal (or private) load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside
a virtual network.A load balancer frontend can be accessed from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario

---what is external load balancer
>>The external load balancer is used to route external HTTP traffic into the cluster

2- Application load balancer
>>A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer whenever the first system not availble then distributes incoming traffic across
multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer

>>it is layer 7 in application layer
>>it uses https and http
>>it is only for web-applications
>>the deregistation delay is 300 seconds
>>you can save your load balancer logs in s3 
>>you can use one listner or port number of times
>>it is region dependent
>>by default cross-zone load balancer is enabled
>>it will check every 30 seconds for health checks if you cant reach the server then decalre as not reachable then forward the request to another server
>>it will support path based routing or url based routing
>>you can transfer the traffic using paths based in application load balancer or  you can use path based routing
>>you can create the multiple target group like home , movies, shows then use the path based routing or url based routing
>>it is used or suitable for complex applications 

88- if any one asking the my load balancer is in public my subnets is private can use this subnets to connect through internet 

>>yes you can connect through internet by using the load-balancer must be public .like when you create the load-balancer it will create in only public not private
you must put app and db servers in private only. you can connect or download patches using nat gateway

>>you can enable in load balancer to connect the particular ip only if your client asked to connect the your website through ip you can give this ip and 
and add that client ip in your load balancer only that client will connect

89- what is cross-zone load-balancer

>>The nodes for your load balancer distribute requests from clients to registered targets. When cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each load balancer 
node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones

>>you have load balancer and 1a availbility zone 4 servers and 1b availbilty zone have 2 servers if the traffic will then it will distribute 50 persent to 1a
and 50 persent 1b then it will get over trafficed by 1b so on that time you can use the cross-zone load balancer then it will distribute same amount of
traffic to every servers in availbilty zones

90- what is ssl-off loading or termination
>>SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic before passing it along to a web server.
            or
>>An SSL connection sends encrypted data between an end-user's computer and web server by using a certificate for authentication. 
SSL termination helps speed the decryption process and reduces the processing burden on backend servers

91- what is round-robin load balancer              -->video 17 40mins

>>Round-robin DNS is a technique of load distribution, load balancing, or fault-tolerance provisioning multiple, redundant Internet Protocol service hosts, 
e.g., Web server, FTP servers, by managing the Domain Name System's (DNS) responses to address requests from client computers according to an appropriate 
statistical model        (or)
>>Round robin load balancing is a simple way to distribute client requests across a group of servers. A client request is forwarded to each server in turn.

How does it works:
>>What Is Round-Robin Load Balancing? Round‑robin load balancing is one of the simplest methods for distributing client requests across a group of servers. 
Going down the list of servers in the group, the round‑robin load balancer forwards a client request to each server in turn.

92- what is target group in load balancer

>>collections of machines and also specified protocols and ports to specified instances
         or
>>A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances, fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others. When creating a 
load balancer, you create one or more listeners and configure listener rules to direct the traffic to one target group

93- what is the use of health checks in aws

>>Health checks are a way of asking a service on a particular server whether or not it is capable of performing work successfully. 
Load balancers ask each server this question periodically to determine which servers it is safe to direct traffic to.

94- Your business prefers to use its email address and domain to send and receive compliance emails. What service do you recommend to implement it easily 
and budget-friendly?

>>This can be accomplished by using Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), a cloud-based   email-sending service.

95- Describe SES.

>>Amazon offers the Simple Email Service (SES) service, which allows you to send bulk emails to customers swiftly at a minimal cost.
>>it will everyday 50000 emails every day like 24 hours. 14 emails per second 
 
96- what is IAM

>>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated 
(signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

97- what are the types IAM policies    -->see in iam.txt read inline policy

>>AWS managed policies:- aws managed by this policies, you can reuse the policies
>>customer managed policies:- you can create and attach the policies to user and groups like giving permssiones and denying users or groups. you can reuse the polices
>>Inline policies:- its like same customer maneged policies but its one to one like one user or role you cant reuse the poliices it is not visible for everyone 
it is visible for only user and it is embed directly into a single user, group, or role.

98- what is IAM policy simulator?

>>Iam policy simulator is used to see the policy briefly what you attached to the users for permisiions what you given

99- what is the differnce between customer managed policy and inline policy

>>A customer managed policy is a standalone policy that you administer in your own AWS account. 
An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role).

100- where we can use roles

>>Roles are a common approach to handling authorization and permissions in a web application. For example, it's common to create an Administrator role that gives 
admin users more permissions or power than normal users. In this project, you'll add a Manage Users page that only administrators can see.
>>roles is also use access-key and secret-key but will not show it will show the token your system but it will be expiry in 6-8 hours then it will create the one more token

101- what is role-switching

>>When you switch to a role, you temporarily give up your user permissions and work with the permissions that are assigned to the role. 
When you exit the role, your user permissions are automatically restored

>>your createing one role giving this access to another accounts then that account can access the your given resources this called role-switching

102- ho you can manage the 20 accounts as acccounts

>>we can use orgnzation create the some group to add and divide specific groups to aws accounts
                              (or)
>>if we have 20 accounts we use master and sub-account architecture we use. master is there we use organzations, properly use organzation units we kept as internal
external and third party we are properly segrgated. then we can apply security control policy ,we can restrict users using permisiion boundary

103- how to secure your system or aws accounts how to see logs 

>>using cloud trail feature enable it send the logs into s3 bucket

104- What is RDS AWS used for?

>>Amazon RDS managed by amazon and it makes easy to setup operate and scale a relational database in the cloud it provides cost efficient and resizable capacity
while automating time consuming administartion tasks. such as hardware provisioning database setup patching and backups
>>Amazon RDS is availble on several databases instance types optimized for memory performance I/O provides familar database like aurora, postgresssql,mysql,mariadb,
oracle database, sql server

>>RDS is structred database
>>RDs is platform as service(paas)
>>you can create read replcia in another region also us-east-1a to ap-south-1a
>>if you createing an database automatically it will create two databases in a region but they don't know
it will connect in primary database ,the primary will sync to secondary database ,if in case primary not availble then secondary will connect 
>>if the primary available zone damaged not available then it will create onemore database in availble region like us-east-1c
>>you will connect only primary database
>>you can't access secondary why because where the database is there don'tknow

105- what is the rds failover time

>>60-120 seconds

106-rds database tpes

1-master(primary)
2-read(secondary)replica       -->you can create read replica

>>some tester has come and asked we have test the rds your not giving the primary you dont
know how to access the secondary that time you can use the read replica
>>read replica just copy a primary you can put another region also
>>in read replica you can't do write on database its only read option

107- Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

>>No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. This is because the entire purpose
of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. As a result, if the primary instance fails, the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.

108- How would you address a situation in which the relational database engine frequently collapses when traffic to your RDS instances increases, given that the RDS instance replica
is not promoted as the master instance?

>>A larger RDS instance type is required for handling significant quantities of traffic, as well as producing manual or automated snapshots to recover data if the 
RDS instance fails

109- What is auto-scaling?

>>Auto scaling groups must not be used for database
>>auto scaling groups is used mostly used web and app servers because of static content
>>Auto-scaling is a function that allows you to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease 
resource capacity in relation to the demand.Cloud Architect Master's
-----types
1-Vertical Scaling :-
>>t2.micro to t4.medium 
>>its need machine shutdown or downtime to increase the size of specification

2-Horizontal Scaling:-
>>t2.micro to t2.micro 
>>if you want increase the system means you need to use horizontal scaling

110- what is SNS

>>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and 
consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel

111- what is deregistration delay

>>Elastic Load Balancing stops sending requests to targets that are deregistering. By default, Elastic Load Balancing waits 300 seconds before completing the 
deregistration process,which can help in-flight requests to the target to complete
         or
>>Connection draining allows you to specify a maximum time (between 1 and 3,600 seconds and default 300 seconds) to keep the connections alive before reporting the
instance as de-registered. The maximum timeout limit does not apply to connections to unhealthy instances.

112- What is Inspector in AWS

>>Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

113- what is lambda and what is use of lambda

>>AWS Lambda is a server-less computing platform that allows engineers to create a small function, configure the function in the AWS console and have the
code executed without the need to provision servers-paying only for the resources used during the execution
>>lambda runs your code high-availbilty compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of your compute resources
>>simply its like an editor(vim,pycharm,sublime text,atom)with some extra features
>>it supports to run differnet languages like python,go,nodejs,java,..etc
>>it is installed or running on amazon linux server and we can access /tmp using lambda function
>>aws lambda needs server it is installed and running amazon linux but your not maintaing thats it
>>lambda execution maximum time is 15mins. maximum file size in lambda is 75gb in a region. maximum thousnd instance in a region

Requirements for AWS Lambda function:-
1-the handler is the entry point for the lambda. the lambda function accepts json formated input and will usaully return the same
2-we usually correlate directly with the language selected to write your function
3-manual trigger or rnby us you can configure a lambda invocation to an event such as upload to s3,dynamodb,API Gateway,AWS Cloudwatch

>>you can stop and start ec2-instance using python boto3 and lambda, Alerting mails if ec2 stop or start and creating EBS snapshots,copy of EBS snapshots

114-differnce between ec2 and lambda

ec2:-
1-ec2 instance how much used you should pay the bill
2-on-demand price. for example your launch one ec2 not using but you should pay the bill
3-install required software
4-user can host the complete application
5-need to update and patches user should maintain

lambda:-
1-when we runing functions on that time you should pay the bill into lambda service
2-AWS Lambad you pay only what you used . your charges based on the number of requests on your functions and duration
3-selecting only required software or runtime
4-it is just peace of code to host the code
5-no need to update the updates and maintian by aws

115-what is concurrency in lambda

>>concurrency is the number of requests that your function is serving any given time when your function is invoked lambda allocates 
an instance of it to process the event when the function code finishes running it can handler another request

116-what is Boto3

>>Boto3 is python libray for aws to make simplefiy your work 
>>Boto3 makes it easy to integrate your Python application, library, or script with AWS services including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and more.

117 - What is Elastic Beanstaclk

>>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web Servicesand it is used deploying and scaleup the AWS services, 
including EC2, S3, Simple Notification Service, CloudWatch, autoscaling, and Elastic Load Balancers, health monitoring

>>Elastic beanstaclk is used  if the developer is developing java application he is checking and deploying in 3 days in a week so we can use elastic beanstaclk
using create servers and required configuration easily

118-what is global acclerator

>>it is like cloud-front or CDN. CDN provides cache server but global-acclerator gives to allow ports and give you can configure fixed entry-points to ip address  
>> AWS Global accelerator is a networking service that helps you to improve the availability zones and performance of the applications that offer you to your 
golbal users. aws global acclerator easy to setup and manage and configure. it provides static ip address and fixed entry point your application. 
global acclerator is basically global load balancer which load balancing the regions as well .it is costly compared to dns load balancer

119-what is WAF in AWS

>>>>it can provide the additional security of your web application. it will hide your servers on the internet
it will prevent cyber attacks like sql injection and xss and ddos attacks 

120-what is cognito

>>Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and authentication to your mobile and web apps. Amazon Cognito also enables you to authenticate users through an 
external identity provider and provides temporary security credentials to access your app's backend resources in AWS or any service behind Amazon API Gateway

>>you can intregrate the third-party signin and login functionalitys

121-what is docker-ECR

>>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports 
private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM

122- what is cloud-formation (it is infrastructure as a code)(IAAS)

>>AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS 
and third-party resources, and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion
                                   (or)
>>AWS CloudFormation simplifies provisioning and management on AWS. You can create templates for the service or application architectures you want 
and have AWS CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning of the services or applications (called “stacks”).

---Advantages
>>CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, 
all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third-party resources.

---Disadvantages
>>CloudFormation uses either JSON or YAML. This makes CloudFormation easy to read and manage. But there is a constraint that doesn't allow AWS developers to 
create CloudFormation templates greater than 51MB in size. In case the template exceeds this size limit, developers need to create a nested stack for the templates.

>we can use this template to create the services we can use this code to version control and if we can modify the code we can easily undesrstand
>>aws cloud-formation uses YAML and JSON lanugauge
>>Save the code in an S3 bucket, which serves as a repository for the code.
>>Use AWS CloudFormation to call the bucket and create a stack on your template

123- if the replacement is true in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation when your are deployed one server and then changed key pair or something nything in your cloud-formation and importing in resource 
through updating when its come true means it will destroy the server or ec2-system and install fresh system or ec2 or resource. 
if it comes false then it update the system or resources

124- what is import-resource in cloud-formation

>>in cloud formation import-resource using. when you acccidentaly created ec2-instance manualy by mistake without deleeting that
you can import that resource using the Import-resource option but you must mention "deletionpolicy": "retain" is mandatory and if you want destory that system using
cloud-formation means first system will delete but next time add system not gone delete because it will using retain policy

125- what is roolback failure in cloud-formation

>>roll-back failure is must be enable. when your deploying code using cloud-formation if gets an error then automatically delete the everything what is deployed 
in cloud-formation 

126- what is designer in cloud-formation

>>AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates. With Designer, you can diagram your 
template  resources using a drag-and-drop interface, and then edit their details using the integrated JSON and YAML editor

127- what is stack policy in cloud-formation

>>stack-policy is used to restrict the updates of your cloud-formation templates of any user anyone

128- what is nested template in cloud-formation

>>nested stack using you can create multiple resource like 3 differnet vpc inside the 3 servers using centrailized url or your cloud formation stored or saved 
in somewhere s3 any where 

129- what is stackset in cloud-formation

>>stacksets using can deploy cloud-formation using the resources in different accounts . this accounts added in your orgnaztion , first need to create the stackset 
role and then create the stack-set execcution rule and give master account id and do same in sub-accounts and give master account id and then copy the ou id 
and then deploy your resources in other accounts if you added two more accounts that accounts also deployed that resources

130- what is detect drift in cloud-formation

>>detect drift is used to identify what is changes done when you deployed in cloud-formation configuration it detect and show you either you can add or delete further
                          (or)
>>Drift is the difference between the expected configuration values of stack resources defined in CloudFormation templates and the actual configuration values of these 
resources in the corresponding CloudFormation stacks.

131- what is code smell

>>Code smells indicate a deeper problem, but as the name suggests, they are sniffable or quick to spot. The best smell is something easy to find but 
will lead to an interesting problem, like classes with data and no behavior.

132-what JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

>>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation . JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
(e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

240-What are the tools used to send logs to the cloud environment?

1-AWS CloudWatch Logs
2-AWS Elastic Beanstalk
3-AWS Lambda
4-Fluentd
5-Logstash

241-How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime?

>>To upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime, you can use the following steps:
1-Set up a load balancer in front of your system.
2-Deploy the new version of your system to a new set of servers.
3-Add the new servers to the load balancer and verify that they are healthy.
4-Remove the old servers from the load balancer.
5-Monitor the system to ensure that everything is running smoothly.
By following this process, you can ensure that your system remains available throughout the upgrade or downgrade process.

242-What is a load balancer? Give scenarios of each kind of balancer based on your experience.

>>A load balancer is a device or service that distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any one server from becoming overwhelmed. 
There are three main types of load balancers:

1-Application Load Balancers (ALBs) distribute traffic based on content at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS).
2-Network Load Balancers (NLBs) distribute traffic at the transport layer (TCP/UDP).
3-Classic Load Balancers (CLBs) distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances and can be used with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

243-What are the kinds of security attacks that can occur on the cloud? And how can we minimize them?

>>The kinds of security attacks that can occur on the cloud include DDoS attacks, phishing attacks, data breaches, and insider attacks. To minimize them, it is important to use
strong authentication methods, implement proper access control and monitoring, encrypt data, keep systems up to date with security patches, and regularly conduct security audits and 
training for employees.

244-an we recover the EC2 instance when we have lost the key?

>>Yes, it is possible to recover an EC2 instance when you have lost the key. You can create a new key pair and then use it to connect to the instance.
Alternatively, you can also use other authentication methods such as user name and password, or even IAM roles to access the instance.
However, if you have encrypted the root volume of the instance using the lost key pair, you will not be able to recover the data on that volume.

245-What is the difference between the Amazon Rds, Dynamodb, and Redshift?

Amazon RDS: Relational database service that allows you to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud easily.

DynamoDB: Fully-managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

Redshift: Data warehousing service that provides fast querying and analysis of data using SQL and business intelligence tools.

246-Do you prefer to host a website on S3? What’s the reason if your answer is either yes or no?

>>Yes, it can be a good option to host a website on S3. Hosting a website on S3 is a cost-effective solution for static websites that don’t require server-side processing.
S3 is a reliable and scalable storage service that offers high availability and durability.
>>However, hosting a dynamic website with server-side processing on S3 is not recommended as it lacks the necessary compute resources and scalability to handle such websites.
In such cases, it’s better to use other AWS services like EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.

247-How would you implement a disaster recovery solution in AWS using RDS, EC2, and S3?

>>Create an Amazon RDS instance in a primary region, and configure automatic backups to Amazon S3.
>>Create an Amazon EC2 instance in the same primary region
>>Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store data backups, and configure the RDS instance to store backups in the S3 bucket.
>>Set up an Amazon EC2 instance in a secondary region and install the necessary software to access the S3 bucket.
>>Create an Amazon RDS instance in the secondary region and configure it as a replica of the primary RDS instance.
>>Configure the secondary RDS instance to automatically fail over to the primary RDS instance in case of a disaster in the secondary region.
>>Regularly test the failover process to ensure it is working as expected.
>>Use Amazon S3 versioning and object lifecycle management policies to retain backups for a desired period of time.
>>Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the RDS instances and EC2 instances, and set up alarms to trigger notifications or automated actions in case of a disaster.

248-Can you describe a scenario in which you would use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy an application?

>>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service offered by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to easily deploy, run and scale web applications. 
The service is ideal for situations where a developer has created a web application using a popular framework, such as Ruby on Rails, Node.js, or Java, and is looking to quickly deploy
the application to a production environment with minimal overhead. AWS Elastic Beanstalk takes care of provisioning the necessary resources, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, 
databases and security groups, and sets up a fully functional environment for the application. This eliminates the need for the developer to manage the underlying infrastructure, 
freeing them up to focus on the development and maintenance of the application itself. Monitoring the health of the application can be done using AWS Elastic Beanstalk’s built-in monitoring 
and reporting features, and updates and changes can be made as needed. This makes AWS Elastic Beanstalk a simple, streamlined solution for deploying and managing web applications, 
particularly well-suited for developers who want a straightforward way to handle the deployment and management of their applications.

249-How would you use AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 for a scalable and highly available static website?

>>AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 can be used together to build a scalable and highly available static website. Here’s an overview of the process:

>>Store the website files in an Amazon S3 bucket and make the files publicly accessible.

>>Create a CloudFront distribution, which is Amazon’s global content delivery network (CDN), and configure it to use the S3 bucket as its origin. This allows CloudFront to serve the 
website files from edge locations around the world, ensuring fast and low-latency access for visitors.

>>Use Amazon Route 53, the highly available and scalable DNS service, to associate a custom domain name with the CloudFront distribution, so visitors can access the website using a 
familiar and memorable domain name.

>>Configure Route 53 to use the health checks and failover features to ensure that the website is always available, even if one of the edge locations becomes unavailable. Finally, 
use S3’s versioning and lifecycle policies to automatically store multiple versions of the website files and to transition older versions to less expensive storage options over time.

250-How would you use AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to monitor and log AWS resource activity and events?

>>AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch are two services that can be used to monitor and log AWS resource activity and events. CloudTrail records API calls made to AWS services and stores 
information about the caller, time of call, source IP address, request parameters, and response elements. This information can be used to track changes to AWS resources and identify 
security threats. CloudTrail trails can be created to specify the AWS resources for which API calls should be recorded and logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for central storage and analysis.

>>CloudWatch Alarms can be set up to trigger when specific conditions are met, such as when an API call is made to a sensitive AWS resource. Alarms can be configured to send notifications 
to specified Amazon SNS topics or to stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance. The logs collected by CloudTrail and stored in CloudWatch Logs can be analyzed to identify trends, 
track resource activity, and diagnose issues.

>>By using CloudTrail and CloudWatch, organizations can have a comprehensive view of AWS resource activity and events, enabling them to identify security threats, troubleshoot issues,
and meet compliance requirements. The centralized logging and analysis provided by these services helps organizations to ensure the security and availability of their AWS resources, 
giving them greater control and visibility into their cloud infrastructure.

251-Can you explain a time when you had to troubleshoot an issue with an AWS application?

>>In my previous role, we had an issue with an EC2 instance not responding to incoming traffic. After reviewing the logs, we discovered that the security group rules were misconfigured,
causing the instance to reject incoming traffic. We adjusted the security group rules to allow the incoming traffic, and the issue was resolved.

252-How have you ensured high availability and fault tolerance for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented AWS Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups to ensure that our application could handle sudden spikes in traffic and maintain high availability.
We also set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the application and alert us in case of any failures, allowing us to quickly respond and ensure fault tolerance.

253-Can you explain a time when you implemented security measures for an AWS application?

>>In my previous role, we implemented several security measures for an AWS application, including setting up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all AWS accounts, enabling AWS CloudTrail
to monitor and log all API activity, and encrypting data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). We also regularly conducted vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to
identify and mitigate potential security risks.

254-How have you implemented disaster recovery for an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we implemented disaster recovery for an AWS application by using AWS Route 53 to route traffic to a secondary region in case of a failure in the primary region. 
We also set up Amazon S3 cross-region replication to ensure that the data was replicated to the secondary region in real-time. Additionally, we created automated backups of the
application data using Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier to ensure that we could quickly restore the data in case of a disaster.

255-Can you describe a time when you had to troubleshoot a performance issue in an AWS application?

>>In a previous project, we had an issue where the application was slow to respond to user requests. After reviewing the logs, we identified that the application was experiencing high CPU
usage. We then analyzed the application’s resource utilization using Amazon CloudWatch and identified that the database queries were taking longer than expected. We optimized the database
queries and improved the performance of the application.

256-what is Flow-logs

>>Flow logs — VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in the VPC and can help in monitoring the 
traffic or troubleshooting any connectivity issues

257-What is the relation between AMI and Instance?

>>Instances can be launched by AMIs. One AMI can launch as many instances as required. An instance type defines the hardware of the host computer including information about computers and
its memory abilities. After launching an instance, it works as a traditional host and could be interacted with as with any other computer.

258-Explain the difference between elasticity from scalability?

>>Elasticity : The ability of a system to handle an increase in the workload by simply adding hardware resources when demand rises, and rolling back scaled resources when there’s no demand.

>>Scalability : ability of a system to increase the hardware resources for handling an increase in demand. It can be achieved by either increasing the hardware specs or increasing the number
of processing nodes.

259-Can you explain the steps to secure an AWS environment using IAM, VPC security groups, and network ACLs

>>Certainly! Securing an AWS environment involves multiple layers of security controls, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups, 
and network ACLs. Here are the steps to secure an AWS environment using these components:

IAM (Identity and Access Management):

Create individual IAM user accounts for each person or system that requires access to your AWS resources.
Assign appropriate IAM policies to each IAM user, granting them the least privilege necessary to perform their tasks.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for IAM users to provide an extra layer of security.
Regularly review and audit IAM policies to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege and remove unnecessary access.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Security Groups:

Define security groups within your VPC to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
Create separate security groups for different types of resources based on their security requirements.
Specify the inbound and outbound rules for each security group, allowing only necessary protocols, ports, and IP ranges.
Regularly review and update security group rules to ensure they align with your organization's security policies.
Avoid overly permissive rules and follow the principle of least privilege.
Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):

Network ACLs act as a firewall for controlling traffic at the subnet level within your VPC.
Define inbound and outbound rules in network ACLs to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports.
Carefully evaluate and configure network ACLs to restrict access to your resources.
Regularly review and update network ACL rules as per your security requirements.
