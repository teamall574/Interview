1-Types of git version control tools

1-git
2-SubVersion
3-CVS
4-perforce

2-What is Git?

>>Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source distributed version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. 
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
>>While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository,

git config:-
=========
>>git config --global user.name "VmTutes"
>>git config --global user.email "vmtutes@gmail.com
>>git config --list   -->it will show the details
>>git remote add origin https://github.com/testing5413/test.git
>>git push -u origin master    -->then it will ask username and password in password place paste a token
>>git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"   -->it will add ssh keys into your private repository 

3-What is GitHub?

>>GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.
>>To provide Internet hosting for version control and software development, GitHub makes use of Git.

4-What’s the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git:-
1-Git is a software
2-git is command line tool
3-Git can be installed locally on the system
4-git mainatained by linux foundation
5-git is focused on version control and code sharing
6-It does not support user management features

github:-
1-GitHub is a service
2-github is graphical user interface
3-GitHub is hosted on the web
4-github maintained by microsoft
5-github is centrailzed source hosting
6-Provides built-in user management

5-git features compare to other tools:-

1. Speed
2. Support for non-linear development(thounds of branches, for parallel development)
3. Able to handle large-scale projects.
4. distributed version control system

6-Is git Distributed or Centralizes version control system? what is the differnce between them

>>git is distributed version control system the major difference is that in centralized version control system you have the client and server architecture and 
server is a remote repository has all the copies of your code like all the version of the code are only availble with server whereas in the distributed version control
system every developer has all the versions of the code like all the copies of code are which and every and every developer who has cloned the remote repository 
so thats why this called distibued version control system

7-Different types of version control systems

>>Local version control systems have a database that stores all file changes under revision control on disc in a special format.
>>Centralized version control systems have a single repository, from which each user receives their working copy.
>>Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories, and different users can access each one with their working copy.

8-what are 4 stages in git

1-creation
2-modification
3-refactoring
4-deletion

9-what are the git commands that you use to commit changes to you remote repository

>>git add, git commit, git push

10-What is a Git repository?

>>Git repository refers to a place where all the Git files are stored. These files can either be stored on the local repository or on the remote repository.

11-what is Git Branch. and how to create a branch and how to change one branch to another branch

>>A branch is a way to isolate development work on a particular aspect of a project. When a branch is created, it diverges from the primary branch. It allows 
developers to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase.
>>In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
>>git branch hello   -->it will create the hello branch
>>git checkout master   -->it will change the hello to master branch
>>git checkout -b anji   -->it will create anji branch and move to anji branch
>>git switch anji   -->it will move to anji branch
>>git branch -d anji           -->delete the anji branch
>>git branch   -->it will show the git branches

12-how to clone private repository in local machine

>>first create the ssh keys using this commands 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub    -->addd public key into github account
git config --global user.name "anji"
git config --global user.email "anji@anji.com"
git config --global core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
then clone your private repository

13-what are the git stages

1-Working directory/space:- where we work perform differnet action on files
2-staging/index Area:- it helps to create commit id(it is virtual area, here workspace dont know which one existing and modifeied area)
3-commit area:- where changes commits permanently and generates commit id's

14-what are the Types of Git Repository

1. bare repo: is the centrailized repository which is used to store and share the changes, but we cannot view the data.
>>git init --bare central.git
>>cd central.git
you can see below files
branches config description HEAD hooks info objects refs
2. non-bare repo: user (or) workspace (or) local repository whih is used to modify,del,create the changes.
			(OR)
1-Local Repository:

A local repository is a Git repository stored on your local machine.
It contains the complete history and version control information of a project.

2-Remote Repository:

A remote repository is a Git repository hosted on a remote server or service.
It acts as a centralized location where multiple developers can collaborate on a project.

15-what are the commands will do before pushing

>>git status
>>git add .
>>git commit -m "anji"
>>git push origin master 

16-what is .git and .gitignore

>>so .git is everything in git so you know .git folder contains all the information like project details and file information everything present in .git file or
folder if you should not be delete that file if you delete that file 
>>dot ignore suggest so if you want to ignore anything from dot git 

17-if your adding your github repository into your system

>>git remote add origin "https://github.com/teamall574/adding.git"

18-what is git merge and what is the use

>>merge will help you to combine two branches
>>Git merge is a command used to combine the changes from one branch into another. It integrates the commit history and changes from one branch (source branch) into another branch
(target branch).
>>git checkout main ##we are going to main branch 
>>git merge feature   ##this going to merge the feature branch into main
uses:-
1-combining branches
2-automatic merging
3-fast-forward merge
4-recursive merge
5-resolving conflicts
6-commiting the merge
7-branch management

19-how to see the logs in git

>>git log   -->it will show all the logs
>git log -1
>>git log -2    -->it will show only last two logs
>>git log --oneline    -->it will show the logs in online
>>git log --grep "ignore"   -->what you want to see  to grep it you will get
>>git log --graph
>>git log --graph --pretty=oneline
>>git show commit id -->>it will show the commits of the code
>>git log "branch name"   -->if the branch name is anji then it will show the logs of anji branch only

20-what is git init

>>The git init command is used to initialize a new Git repository in a directory. It sets up the necessary data structures and files that Git uses to manage version control for your project.
Here are the key aspects of the git init command:

21-what is git status

>>The git status command is helpful for understanding the current state of your Git repository and determining which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked

22-what is git add 

>>The git add command is used to stage changes in your working directory and prepare them for a commit. It allows you to select specific files or parts of files to be included in the next
commit. Here's how the git add command works:

23-what is git commit

>>A commit is a way to save changes to a branch. When a commit is made, a snapshot of the current state of the branch is created. 
This snapshot can be used to revert the branch to that state if necessary.

24-what is git push 

>>The Git push command is used to push the content in a local repository to a remote repository. After a local repository has been modified,
a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team members.

25-what is git clone

>>cloneing is nothing copying of the file into remote to local

26-how many ways to clone the git repo into the local system

1-Using the Command Line.
2-Using the Git GUI.
3-Using Visual Studio.

27-What is git pull

>>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

28-what is the differnce between git pull and fetch 

>>Both of these commands will fetch any new commits from the remote repository, but they differ in how they handle these commits.
>>if you want use git fetch you need to enter first git fetch then you need to use git merge then new commits will come into your local repository
>>if you git pull automatically uses this git pull=git merge+git fetch
>>git pull directly code from github there is a disadvantage is there like some is pushed the code but the code is wrong if you pull directly 
pull the code grom github to your local system directly
>>same scenraio in git fetch if you git fetch it will pull the code but will not merge into local code it will goto staging area then you can review and 
then you can git merge then it will meege into local code there is disadvantage is that need to review your code and again you can merge the code 
>>the advantage is that to you can review your code bfore merging locally

29-what is git revert 

>>This command	helps you in reverting a commit, to a previous version
 
>>git revert 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
then push
>>git push -u origin master

30-how to see the differnce between commits

>>git diff "commit-id 1" "commit-id 2"

31-how to retrive deleted data or commit and how to push into the any branch

>>git checkout 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

then push

>>git push origin feature1

32-how to see the modification in your file

>>git diff HEAD .

33-how to delete the untracked file in git 

>>git clean -f

34-how to add tags in a file

if you want to add important file to tag in your commit

>>git tag -a important -m "this very important" commit-id

>>git show important

>>git tag -d important   -->it will delete the file what you tagged important

35-how to edit the your username and mail in git in your local system

>>git config --edit --global
then change what you want

36-can you explain branching strategy what you are using

>>we are feature branching startegy we master development and remaing short-lived branches we are using the developer will commit the code into the short-lived branch 
the code will review by team head then we can test that ci/cd in every commit if that happiens successfully then we can push into the development testing and q&a then 
we can push into the master branch

>>two types of branching strategy

git model:-
we have two branches long-lived branches
1-master
2-development    -->this not gone delete 

>>we are not commiting any code into the git like master and developement branch
>>we use feature branch for if we have release in nest week we can create the feature branch we can develop the code into the feature if the developing code is 
complted we push into the development branch like first we can pull the code into the local and then we cna push into the code 
>>pull before push that is also we can create the pull request to head of the branch member will review that code and accept the pull request or if any changes 
then we can do one more changes
>>the source is feature branch to development branch
>>when we push the code into the development then we can do q&a testing and testing and pre-prod testing then we can push into the production and development and 
then iwe will create next release next month or next week we work together
>>whenever we chnages something the code will be availble in development and master branch
hotfix:- we can create the one branch we can test the code push into development

3-feature
4-release
5-hotfix     -->this can delete any time 
1-name
2-long lived short lived 
3-source and destination
4-merge how to promte prod
5-conflicts

>>we use this startegy
feature branching strategy:-
feature branching strategy:-

>>main branches are master and development remaing all are features or test branches
>>we can push the code into the feature branch whenever the commit happens we are create ci/cd job in jenkins and test if the ci/cd happens perfectly 
we can push into the development branch. then we can send it into the q&a testing and pre-prod trhen we can push into the release or production directly
>>this happens daily basis or weekly basis if the code corectly working we can release daily basic
>>if another developer working together means they need to pull the code first into the github then he can develop the code 

37-what is the differnce between git clone and git fork

>>your creating a copy of whatever remote repository that is 
>>where as git fork is that your getting the git repository into your namespace 

38-What do you understand about the Git merge conflict?

>>A Git merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to resolve the differences in code between the two commits automatically. 

Git is capable of automatically merging the changes only if the commits are on different lines or branches.

39 - how to solve merge conflicts

>>git throughs the conflicts when the differnce content of the same lines both party should work together. and decide which one should be there which 
one should delete. and they have to merge there codes create merge commit
>>onc we have Identified the merge conflicts we can use this tool ex:- git mergetool
>>merge conflicts occur when we try to merge two branches which we have the same file updated by two differnet developers.

developer finished his code and pushes the changes to master branch

main ()
{
function1()
{
//intial code
}
function2()
{
//developer A code
}
}

developerB finished his code and pushes the chnages to master branch
main ()
{
function1()
{
//intial code
}
function3()
{
//developer B code
}
}

when the deleoper B pushes the code we can cause the Merge conflicts problem

40-what is git merge and rebase

>>Git merge is a command used to combine the changes from one branch into another. It integrates the commit history and changes from one branch (source branch) into another branch
(target branch).
>>Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
>>git rebase main

41-what is the differnce between git merge and rebase

>>both of them are actually designed to do same purpose that means if you want bring the code changes from one branch to other branch like you have changes that 
you want to bring from branch x to branch y you can do either git merge or git rebase both of them does the same purpose but the only differnce is how they are 
projectig the history
>>if you have x branch and y branch then your merging y to x branch the history and every commit will be there
>>if you have x branch and y branch then your rebaseing y to x branch the y data and commits will be deleted only x branch commits and data will be shown i recomended to use git merge 
>>Merge is best used when the target branch is supposed to be shared. Rebase is best not used in public branches and used when the target branch is private. Merge preserves history. 
Rebase rewrites history.

42-what is git cherry-pick command

>>git cherry-pick command is used to merge the particular one commit only you can do
like your have 100 of commits in your branch your want mergr that into master or any feature branch if you merge 100 commits will go you dont want that 
you can do simply git cherry-pick "commit-id" it will merge only onthat commit id data into that branch 
# switch to main branch
$ git checkout main
# cherry-pick the commit
$ git cherry-pick commit_hash

43-what is the differnce between merge and pull request

>>pull request will do happen two different account on the github to merge there is no differencegit merge or pull requst both are mostly same  
>>Then a git merge is executed to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit. two different branches combine into pne branch 

44-what is git stash

>>git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
>>git stash save "manager call"   -->it will stash the file
>>git stash list   -->it will list stash files and names
stash@{0}
>>git stash apply stash@{0}   -->it will unstash the file
>>git stash clear   -->it will delete the stash files
>>git stash pop   --> it will apply and remove the last stash array[0]
>>git stash drop  --> it will drop the latest one (or) you can specify perticular one also eg:- git stash drop stash@{3}

45-what is trufflehog and how to use it

>>Now, on to the more popularly used scanning tool — truffleHog. This GitHub repository scanner will look into your commit 
history and spot anything that looks like a password or confidential information using regex and entropy.

46-What is git pull

>>The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

47-what is pre-commit hooks and post-commit hooks 

Hooks:Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository.

>>git hooks are allow you to run your own scripts whenever important events occur in the git-life-cycle. like commiting merging and pushing.
>>git hooks run locally. git hooks are built in feature no need to download anything
>>hooks are there in .git/hooks folder
>>pre-commit hooks are the actions that are taken before you do git commit and 
you can create precommit hooks .git folder under hooks you can create custom scripts if the script satifys you can push the code into github .otherwise you cant push 
the code into github(ex:-you can create git config.username, git config.gmail like wise your created mail but not gmail configuration you cant push the code into github
>>post commit hooks are the actions that are taken by after git commit

48-what is webhook

>>webhook is part of github it is used to trigger or perform action trigger pipeline or python program after your git commit is done you want github to 
perform actions so simply you can configure a webhook 

49-what is the differnce between git clone and git fork

>>your creating a copy of whatever remote repository that is 
>>where as git fork is that your getting the git repository into your namespace 

50-what is github Actions

>>GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline

51-what is protection in github

>>You can protect important branches by setting branch protection rules, which define whether collaborators can delete or force push to the branch and
set requirements for any pushes to the branch, such as passing status checks or a linear commit history.
>>you can restrict adminstors also need to review some one need to add you can also add how many members need to approve that then if they approve 
then you can push into the master branch
>>go to settings >>branches >>select branch protection

52-what is git reset hard???

>>Summary. To review, git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. 

three types of git reset
                or
>>git reset --hard , which will completely destroy any changes and remove them from the local directory.

>>git reset --soft , which will keep your files, and stage all changes back automatically

>>git reset --mixed, which will keep the files and it will come to the staging back like you will see it commited you can chnage what you want and commit into the directory

53-what are the git commands that you use to commit changes to you remote repository

>>git add, git commit, git push

54-types of files in git

1-tracked files
2-untracked files
3-ignored files

55-what is git snapshorts

>>it store difference between the files in the form of snapshort

56-what is git tags

>>to identify/reference for a commitid to quick access/ creating specific point in history for our repository
git tag -a <tag-name> -m "comment" <commitid> --> annotated tag
git tag -delete <tag-name>   -->delete the tag

57-what is git reflog

>>it shows when we commit,checkout branch, reset....etc
>>git reflog 
>>git reflog show --all
>>git reflog show <branch_name>
>>git reflog master@{1.minute.ago}
>>git reflog show HEAD@{5}

58-What are the benefits of branching?

1-Parallel Development
2-Feature isloation
3-Versioning and Release Management
4-Experimentation and Prototyping:
5-Code Review and Collaboration
6-Bug Fixing
Source control branching saves time and effort in an agile environment while promoting productivity.
>>Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch.
Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.

59-What is origin in Git?

>>Origin refers to the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from and is used instead of the original repository’s URL.

60-What is the difference between resetting and reverting?

>>git reset changes the state of the branch to a previous one by removing all of the states after the desired commit,

>>git revert does it through the creation of new reverting commits and keeping the original one intact.

61-What is ‘staging area’ or ‘index’ in Git?

>>Now that our sourcce code files data files configuration files are being tracked by Git we will add the files that we want to 
commit to the staging area by git add command. this process can be also called indexing we can also that index constitues of files added to the staging area

62-What is Head in Git?

>>Git maintains a variable for referencing, called HEAD to the latest commit in the recent checkout branch. So if we make a new commit 
in the repo then the pointer or HEAD is going to move or change its position to point to a new commit.

63-how to restore the file your already modifed it will show the file how to remove the file or how to remove from untracked-area

>>git restore anji.txt   -->your modified the file only it will remove the file from untracked area
>>git add anji.txt   ->your send the file into tracking stage and its then something wrong need to restore from tracked area then use this command below
>>git restore --staged anji.txt
>>git restore anji.txt

>>red colour  -->untracked
>>blue colour  -->tracked or staged area       

64-what is git bisect

>>the git bisect command helps you to perform a binary search to identify which commit introduced a bug or regression in the codebase

65-how to check the remote repository in git in your local system

>>git remote -v how to see the remote repositorys in your local system
>>git push -u origin main  -->master is deprected so use main only
>>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git
>>git push --set-upstream origin anji  -->this will push the code to anji

66-Explain how you would set up a Git repository to run code checks automatically when someone pushes a change.

>>This can be done using Git hooks, specifically the pre-receive hook on the server side, or the pre-push hook on the client side. You can also use CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, 
or other tools to run checks automatically on push.

67-How do you synchronize a forked GitHub repository with the original repository?

>>This can be done by adding the original repository as a remote (git remote add upstream <repo-url>), fetching the updates (git fetch upstream), and then merging the updates 
into your fork (git merge upstream/main).

68-What are some advanced features of GitHub that you find particularly useful and why?

>>The answer to this will depend on the individual's experience, but may include features like GitHub Actions, code scanning, security advisories, pull request reviews, the dependency graph, and others.

69-What do you consider best practices for managing branches in Git?

>>Always create a new branch for new features or fixes, regularly merge the main branch into your branch to keep it up-to-date, delete branches after their changes have been merged, and use 
meaningful branch names.

70-How can one revert a pull request in GitHub?

>>To revert a pull request in GitHub, you can use the "Revert" button in the GitHub interface. This creates a new pull request that undoes all changes made in the original pull request.

71-What are some strategies you might use to keep the history of a Git repository clean?

>>Strategies include interactive rebase to squash or fixup commits, avoiding unnecessary merge commits with rebasing, using git commit --amend for fixing recent mistakes, and using descriptive 
commit messages to clearly articulate changes.

72-Explain the use and benefit of a Git submodule.

>>Submodules allow you to keep another Git repository in a subdirectory of your repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

73-How do you enforce code quality standards and reviews in GitHub?

>>This can be accomplished through a combination of tactics, including pull request templates, code review procedures, continuous integration checks, and using GitHub's built-in "protected branches" 
feature to require certain checks pass before merging.

74-How would you handle large files or large amounts of binary data in a Git repository?

>>Git is not designed to handle large files or large volumes of binary data. The Git LFS (Large File Storage) extension can be used for versioning large files while keeping them out of the actual Git repository.

75-Could you explain how to squash commits in Git?

>>Squashing is the process of combining several commits into a single one. This is usually done in the context of cleaning up a feature branch before merging into main. This is typically performed through
an interactive rebase, for example, git rebase -i HEAD~n (where 'n' is the number of commits to squash from the current HEAD).

"Squashing" in Git is a technique used to clean up your commit history.
Here's a simple way to understand it:

Imagine that you're working on a big project and you've made a bunch of changes. Each time you make a set of related changes, you "commit" them, which is like saving your work in a special way that 
Git can keep track of. After a few days, you might have made 10 commits.

But maybe you realize that all these changes were really just about one thing, like "adding a new feature" or "fixing a bug". It's a bit messy to have all these separate commits about the same thing.
This is where "squashing" comes in.

"Squashing" is like taking a stack of papers, each with different parts of a story written on them, and combining them all onto one page. With squashing in Git, you take all those different commits and 
combine them into a single commit. This makes your project's history cleaner and easier to understand.

In short, squashing in Git is all about tidying up your project's history by combining multiple commits into one.

76-What's your approach to secure a Git repository?

>>This could involve measures such as using SSH keys for authentication, regularly updating and auditing contributor access, implementing commit signing to verify the authenticity of commits,
using .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive data, and using security tools to automatically scan your repositories for security vulnerabilities or secrets.

77-How do you go about resolving a binary file conflict?

>>Binary files cannot be merged like text files, so you have to decide which version to keep. You can do this with git checkout --ours filename or git checkout --theirs filename and then commit the 
resolved file.

78-What are the steps to perform a rebase in Git?

>>A rebase can be performed using the following steps:
–	Switch to the branch you want to rebase: git checkout feature-branch
–	Start the rebase process: git rebase master
–	If there are any conflicts, resolve them. After resolving conflicts, use git add . to stage the resolved files, then continue the rebase with git rebase --continue.
–	If you want to abort the process at any time, use git rebase --abort.

79-How would you undo the most recent commit in Git?

>>You can use the command git reset --soft HEAD~1 to undo the most recent commit, keeping the changes in the staging area, or git reset --hard HEAD~1 to discard the changes completely.

80-Can you describe a typical Git workflow you would use in a collaborative project?

>>A common workflow is the feature branch workflow. This involves creating a new branch whenever you want to work on a new feature. The master branch should never contain broken code, 
it is always production-ready. All development is done in branches and then merged into the master branch once the feature is complete and tested.
