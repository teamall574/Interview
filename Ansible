1-what is Ansible

>>Ansible is an open-source automation tool. and it follows push mechansim
>>Ansible is Idempotent
>>Ansible is an open-source software provisioning configuartion management and application deployment tool
>>Ansible is used for managing multiple servers in the infrastructure
>>it is very very simple to setup and yet powerful tool
>>parallel operations are possible
>>no need save the code in each server 
>>Ansible will be helpful to perform:-
configuration management
application deployment
task automation
and also it orchestration

push:-
1-it will push the configuration to the server 
2-The control node connects directly to the target systems (managed nodes) over SSH or WinRM, and it executes tasks and playbooks remotely.
3-The control node initiates the execution, pushes the configuration or tasks to the remote systems, and collects the results.
4-Push mode is suitable for managing remote systems without requiring agent software to be installed on the managed nodes. Ansible connects to these nodes on-demand to perform tasks.
pull:-
1-this server will go the server connect pull the configuration
2-Pull mode is typically used when it's not feasible to initiate connections from a central control node. It's often used in larger, more distributed environments
3-The target systems periodically check for playbook updates or configuration changes.
4-When updates are detected, the managed nodes pull the necessary playbooks and execute them locally.

2-why Ansible why not puppet or chef

>>it is a free open-source automation tool
>>using existing openssh
>>agentless-no need to install any agent on ansible on clients
>>it uses yaml 
>>and it follows push mechansim
>>large number of ready to use modules for system management
>>custom modules can be added if needed

3-what is pre-requisites for Ansible

>>python adn pip
>>pip install ansible
>>windows dont support cluster/control node only linux support

4-how many ways create connection between managed to node/cluster to clients or worker nodes

>>two ways to create the ssh connection 
1-password authentication
2-password less authentication(this is with ssh keys)

5-what is Ansible home directory and which consists of

>>/etc/ansible
consist of
1-ansibel.cfg
2-hosts
3-roles

6-what is Inventory file

>>the collection of hosts is know as Ansible Inventory
>>The Ansible Inventory file defines the list of hosts upon which anisble works
>>The Inventory is a description of the nodes (can be a single machine, group of machines or even remote systems) that can be accessed by Ansible.
>>The Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The file can be in one of 
many formats depending on your Ansible environment and plugins. Common formats include INI and YAML.

7-how many types of invnetory files

Two types
1-static:-
>>This is a static file managed by the ansible operators. This file has a list of devices that can be in the form of IP addresses or hostnames.
2-Dynamic:-you are creating the file and giving the path
A dynamic inventory plugin allows users to point at data sources to compile the inventory of hosts that Ansible uses to target tasks, 
either via the -i /path/to/file and/or -i 'host1, host2' command line parameters or from other configuration sources.
Dynamic inventory is used when the targets are not known until the playbook run time. It can be based on a script, API call, or cloud providers.

8-What is host key checking?

>>In host key checking, ssh automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with. 
Host keys are stored in ~/. ssh/known_hosts in the user's home directory. Additionally, the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is automatically checked for known hosts.

>>when you not copyied your ssh keys into worker node .and your accessing the node using ssh it will ask yes or no this called host key checking

9-how to disable host key checking

>>vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
host_key-checking= false
exit
>>this temporary
export host_key_checking= false ## if the system restarts automatically wipeed up 

10-how you will manage your ansible

>>no of devops engineer working together that reason i just created my own folder copied that files into that folder and changed inventory path location so
we can your configuartion easily because you will confuse with the other servers also
>>mkdir ansible_prod
>>cd ansible_prod
>>cp -r /etc/ansible/*  . 
it will copy that files you can change your config hosts and everything 

11-what is group in inventory files

>>dividing hosts into specific group easy to manage the servers
[web-servers]
10.24.25.45
10.24.25.56
[db-servers]
10.24.25.36
10.24.25.37
[app-servers]
10.24.25.46
10.24.25.65

>>ansible all -m ping ##it will ping all servers even your created group but you can use the all means it will ping all ips of your groups

12-what is ansible.cfg file in ansible

>>ansible.cfg file is simple ansible configuration file you can o some setting in ansible.cfg thoe settings will use by ansible while running ad-hoc commadns 
are playbooks or modules
settings like
>>location of inventory file
>>host_key_checking 
>>forks=5

vi /etc/ansible.ansible..cfg  -->this is the path location

13-what is Adhoc commands

>>Ansible commands are useful to execute one task to your remote node or nodes or groups. Ad-hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not re-usable and there
is no idempotant in Ad-hoc commnads. Ad-hoc commands are like one-line playbooks to perform a specific task only. The syntax for the ad-hoc command is
>>Ad hoc commands are simple, standalone, one-liner ansible commands which are used for quick tasks where writing a playbook could be an overkill.

14-what is Ansible playbook

>>playbooks are nothing but whatever the individual task your going to execute your going to get with adhoc commands those adhoc commands going to written 
in a playbook
>>Ansible Playbooks are sets of 'plays' or 'tasks' used to define automation jobs in Ansible, they are written in YAML format.
>>Ansible Playbooks are lists of tasks that automatically execute against hosts. Groups of hosts form your Ansible inventory. 
>>ansible is text file written in yaml format and normal saved as .yaml

15- What exactly is a configuration management tool?

>>Configuartion management is tool is a helps adminstarotrs to mainstain system consistency and it is known as configuartion neforcemnt. it is used to deploy
your software packages and applications adn updates and patches and installtion and deploymeny
>>>>Configuration management tools help keep a system running within the desired parameters. They help reduce deployment time and substantially 
reduce the effort required to perform repetitive tasks. Popular configuration management tools on the market today include Chef, Puppet, Salt, 
and of course, Ansible.

16-what is Ansible modules or (collection->2.10 its called collection) ->2.9 before its called modules 

>>module is nothing pre-defined program that program is able to execute is task on your managed nodes .A module is a reusable, standalone script that Ansible 
runs on your behalf, either locally or remotely. Modules interact with your local machine, an API,or a remote system to perform specific tasks like 
changing a database password or spinning up a cloud instance.

>>creating users
>>installing packages
>>updating configuartion
>>spinning up instances etc

17-how many modules is ther in ansible 

>>ansible-doc -l | wc -l  --->it will show the list
>>2834

18-types of modules or collection in ansible

1-yum
2-apt
3-copy
4-service
5-file
6-template
7-git
8-command
9-debug
10-ping
11-fetch
12-patch
13-stat
14-unarchive
15-get_url
16-tasks
17-raw
18-user
19-replace
20-import_role
21-import_tasks

19-what is ansible forks

>>if you have ten servers in host file, but ansible forks it will run first 5hosts and then execute next 5hosts. it will run only 5hosts
Ansible uses batches for task execution, which are controlled by a parameter called forks . The default value for forks is 5, which means Ansible executes a
task on the first five hosts, waits for the task to complete, and then takes the next batch of five hosts, and so on

20-what is gather facts

>>gather-facts is equal to setup command nothing but its going to pull the target system related information this is the default task every playbook

>>we can restrict the gather_facts why means if you have 100 servers it will collect all the its take ongtime thats why we can restrict if necessary
>>ansible all -m setup         -->it will show all the gather_facts 
>>vi te.yml
---
- name: this playbook create a file or dir
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: creating a file
    file:
      path: /home/ansadmin/dir1
      state: directory
:wq

>>ansible-playbook te.yml

>>this will help you

21-what is Anisble facts or gather facts

>>the task of collecting the remote system information is called gather_facts. Yes, we can create custom facts using the set_fact module or using local scripts.
>>Ansible facts are nothing but information about managed nodes like OS distribution,release, processor, python etc
>>by executing the playbook or adhoc commands automatically collect the facts it will take some time if you have 100 servers that 100 servers facts will collect 
the data it will take the time so you can disable the facts

>>ansible all -m setup         -->it will show all the gather_facts 
>>vi te.yml
---
- name: this playbook create a file or dir
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: creating a file
    file:
      path: /home/ansadmin/dir1
      state: directory
:wq

>>ansible-playbook te.yml

22-types of ansible facts

>>there are two types of ansible facts or variable
1-default-facts:-by default you will you cant modify
2-custom-facts:-you can modify the facts custom you want

23-why we need custom facts

>>you can create you custom scripts are playbook you can reducce the number of lines
your having number of servers you ant take inventory like versions are git version,httpd version you can customize the facts waht you want you can create 

24-what is raw module

>>raw: executes low-level commands where the interpreter is missing on the target host, a common use case is for installing python. This module should not be used 
in all other cases (where command and shell are suggested)

25-what is ansible varibales

>>ansible variables are used to store the values
>>types of variables
1-default variables:-
Ansible defines some variables for us and these are very helpful
1-inventory_hostname
2-inventory_hostname_short
3-group/group.keys()
2-inventory variables(host & groups)
3-register variables

26-why we need to use the playbooks in ansible

>>ad-hoc commands are not helpful when dealing with multiple tasks 
>>if you want install multiple packages you need to run number of commands so that reason we can use playbookwe can install or deploy number of tasks easy way in 
single playbook 

27-what is ignore errors in ansible

>>if your running a playbook in differnet servers install the packages but 25 server package is not installed then after remaing servers will not execute the task
if we add the ignore errors then if 25 server failed then it will continue and install reaing system or servers

28-What language does Ansible use?

>>Python
>>Ansible is a tool written in Python, and it uses the declarative markup language YAML to describe the desired state of devices and configuration

29-structure of playbook

>>concepts:-
1-task
2-play
3-playbook

30-what is data structure or data collections

>>data structure or data collections are used to store multiple values

31-what is the difference between Ansible and chef

>>Another key distinction is that Ansible uses YAML, a Python-based configuration language that is easier to learn and oriented to administrators, whereas Chef 
uses Ruby, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is oriented to developers and has a steeper learning curve
>>Cookbooks vs. Playbooks: So what’s this all about? Ansible’s playbooks are easier to grasp as a concept as well as to create, but you pay for that with the 
limitation on how complex you can make your configuration tasks.

32-what is command line arguments in ansible

>>command line arguments are useful to pass variables from command line

33-what is handler and notify

>>•	Handlers are just like regular tasks but run only when notified by another task. They are used to manage services like restarting a service when a config file changes.
>>lets assume that you have two tasks and you want execute the second task if the first task is chnaged. simplelly if the first task is changed then execute the second task
>>handlers are basically similar to the normal tasks in ansible but they only run when a task contains notify directive lets assume that you have basic task 
in your ansible for example for creation of an nginx your installing httpd or nginx so the next step is basically start the service so in some cases you only
want to start on conditional basis you can use this directive called notify and this notify would call the task that you create din the handler and that gets 
called its basically calling whenever it is required 

34-what is tags in ansible

>>tags are useful to execute/skip required tasks from number of tasks

35-what is ansible import and include

>>Ansible has two modes of operation for reusable content with Including and Importing and Roles: dynamic and static. The main difference is: All import* statements
are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed. All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution of the playbook
>>all import statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed
>>all include statements are processed at they encountered during the execution of the playbooks

36-what is template Module

>>A template is a file that contains all your configuration parameters, but the dynamic values are given as variables in the Ansible. During the playbook execution,
it depends on the conditions such as which cluster you are using, and the variables will be replaced with the relevant values.

37-What is Ansible Vault?

>>ansible vault is feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files
rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles
>>Ansible vault is used to keep sensitive data such as passwords instead of placing it as plaintext in playbooks or roles. 
Any structured data file or any single value inside the YAML file can be encrypted by Ansible.

>>ansible-vault craete encrypt install.yml
it will ask password create the password anji
>>ansible-vault view install.yml
it will ask the password anji
>>ansible-vault edit install.yml
it will ask the password anji    -->you can edit the data

>>ansible-vault encrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml
>>ansible-vault decrypt foo.yml bar.yml baz.yml

38-Do you think Ansible is better than other configuration management tools? if yes why

>>basically there is lot of configuration management tools available in the market so justify ansible is better ansible is differnet from other 
configuration management tools and it is better in acheving a specific use case Ansible is agentless 

39-I would like to run a specific set of tasks only on windows VMS and not linux VMS is it possible

>>yes using tags or conditional basis scripts

40-Does Ansible support Parallel execution of tasks 

>>if assigning 10 tasks in 5 server it will 1 task then run in 5 servers then it will execute the second task 

41--what is the protocol that Ansible uses to connect the Windows VMs

>>Ansible uses Winrm to connect Windows and ssh to connect the Linux

42-how do you handle secrets in Ansible

>>Ansible vault store all your secrets in an encrypted way

43-can we Ansible is IAC > Infrastructure as a code? If yes can you compare with any other IAC tools like Terraform

>>Ansible also supports IAC I will not say Infrastructure as a code tool because predominantly Ansible is a configuration management tool there is a 
cross pf paths ansible also achieve some of the tasks that Terrfform can do but I would say Ansible is configuartion management tool

44-what do you think that Ansible can improve

>>Ansible curreently not provide option to increase the verbosity of teh tasks like can improve is that aspects it can provide verbosity on the task basic uh 
this is one of the most liked issue

>>Ansible windows support can be improved we all know that ansible supports windows but the support for linux is much better than winodws and windows support
can be need to improve

45-What language does Ansible use?

>>Python
>>Ansible is a tool written in Python, and it uses the declarative markup language YAML to describe the desired state of devices and configuration

46-what is Roles

>>In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier
to reuse. The breaking of playbook allows you to logically break the playbook into reusable components.
>>you have multiple tasks and handlers and varibles files you can specfiy the code into differnt files and then you can write the file below
>>role is an independent block of tasks, files, templates, and variables, which can be used to automatically load certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure.

>>ansible-galaxy init anji
>>cd anji
>>ls
-tasks:-contains the main list of taks
-handlers:-contains handlers which may be used by this role
-defaults:-defaults variables for the role
-vars:- other variables for the role
-files:- contains files which can be deployed via this role
-templates:- contains templates which can be deployed in this role
-meta:-defines some meta data for this role

>>vi roles.yml

46-Is Ansible mutable or immutable

>>Mutable>>A mutable object can be changed after it's created, and an immutable object can't.

47-What is the Ansible Galaxy?

>>Ansible Galaxy is a shared repository for Ansible roles. Users can use Galaxy to share roles, and to use roles created by other users.

48-What is idempotency in Ansible?

>>Idempotency means that operations in Ansible can be run multiple times without changing the result after the first successful run.

49-Explain the Ansible architecture.

>>Ansible's architecture is straightforward, it interacts with managed nodes through the ansible program that is installed on the control node. The connection can be either using SSH (default) or 
other protocols.

50-What is Ansible Tower?

>>Ansible Tower is Ansible's enterprise-level product for centralized and controlled IT automation.

51-What is an Ansible task?

>>A task is a block of code inside a playbook which calls an Ansible module.

52-How do you manage different environments in Ansible?

>>You can manage different environments by using separate inventory files or separate directories per environment.

53-What is a check mode in Ansible?

>>The check mode (also called dry run) is used for testing playbooks without making any changes on the remote host.

54-What is Jinja2 in Ansible?

>>Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python, which is used in Ansible for manipulating variables.

55-What are the limitations of Ansible?

>>Ansible can be slower due to its push-based architecture, it is not suitable for real-time data processing, and the documentation might not cover all use-cases.

56-How do you organize playbooks for different environments?

>>Different environments can be handled using separate inventory files or using group_vars and host_vars directories.

57-How do you use Ansible for continuous deployment or continuous delivery?

>>Ansible can be used for continuous deployment or delivery by automating tasks and using Ansible Tower/AWX for orchestration.

58-How do you debug an Ansible Playbook?

>>Ansible playbook can be debugged using the debug module, verbosity flags like -v, -vv, -vvv, or using the ansible-playbook --step and --list-tasks commands.

59-How do you optimize the performance of Ansible in large environments?

>>Performance can be optimized using strategies like "free" or "fastest", pipelining, fact caching, and controlling the number of forks.

60-Explain the difference between 'include' and 'import' in Ansible.

>>'import' is static and is executed when the playbook is loaded. 'include' is dynamic and is executed during the runtime.

61-How do you create custom Ansible modules?

>>Custom Ansible modules can be created in any language that can return JSON, though they are usually written in Python.

62-How do you use Ansible for network automation?

>>Ansible can be used for network automation by using modules specifically designed for networking devices. It can automate tasks like configuration management, test and validate the current network state, etc.

63-What are lookup plugins in Ansible?

>>Lookup plugins are used to retrieve data from outside sources such as files, databases, or other systems.

64-How do you handle backends with varying capabilities in Ansible?

>>You can handle backends with varying capabilities using conditional tasks based on the gathered facts or variables.

65-What is the 'async' mode in Ansible?

>>'async' mode allows a task to continue in the background while the playbook continues executing the next tasks.

66-What are some of the strategies in Ansible?

>>Strategies control the order of task execution. Some of them are linear, debug, and free strategies.

67-What is the purpose of the 'delegate_to' keyword in Ansible?

>>'delegate_to' allows you to perform a task on a host other than the current one in the playbook.

68-How do you test your Ansible roles?

>>Ansible roles can be tested using tools such as Molecule, ansible-lint, or using CI/CD pipelines.

69-What is magic variable in Ansible?

>>Magic variables in Ansible are special variables that have a predefined meaning in Ansible. Some of them include hostvars, group_names, groups, and others.

70-How do you manage rolling updates with Ansible?

>>Ansible can manage rolling updates with the 'serial' keyword in playbooks, which allows you to define how many hosts you want to manage at a time.

71-Can Ansible use APIs for automation? How?

>>Yes, Ansible can use APIs for automation. This can be achieved by using the URI module in Ansible, which can interact with a lot of different APIs.

72- How would you handle a situation where you needed to manage a large number of hosts in Ansible? What strategies might you use?

>>With Ansible, managing a large number of hosts can be effectively done through a well-structured inventory file, utilizing host groups, and using variables for configuration settings. 
This makes it easier to manage configurations across all systems or across a group of systems.

73- Can you describe a scenario in which you would use Ansible handlers?

>>Handlers are tasks that only run when notified by another task. They're useful in scenarios where you want to minimize the number of actions performed. For instance, if you're updating a configuration
file for a service, you might use a handler to restart that service - but the handler will only run if the configuration file actually changed.

74-If an Ansible playbook fails in the middle, what steps would you take to debug it?

>>Ansible provides a --step and --start-at-task debugging facility that can be used to debug playbooks. You can also increase the verbosity of the Ansible command using the -v options to understand what
went wrong.

75-In what scenario would you choose to use a template in Ansible? Can you provide an example?

>>Templates in Ansible are useful when you want to dynamically generate configuration files based on variables. For example, if you are deploying a web server to different environments
(like staging and production), you might use a template for the server's configuration file, with variables for settings that change between environments.

76-Suppose you have a playbook that deploys a multi-tier application. How could you structure this playbook to ensure the database is set up before the application server?

>>You can use different plays within the same playbook to orchestrate this kind of multi-tier setup. The first play would target the database servers and contain tasks to set up the database. 
The second play would target the application servers and contain tasks to deploy the application, and it would only start once the first play has completed.

77-How would you test an Ansible playbook before running it on production servers?

>>You could use tools like Vagrant or Docker to create a local environment that matches your production environment as closely as possible, and then run your playbooks against that. 
You might also use ansible- playbook --check to do a "dry run" of the playbook. Ansible Molecule is also a popular tool for testing Ansible roles.

78-Describe a scenario where using ansible-pull might be more appropriate than the usual ansible or ansible-playbook commands.

>>ansible-pull is useful in a scenario where the managed nodes are not always online or reachable. For example, laptops that are part of a roaming workforce could use ansible-pull to apply configurations
whenever they're online, rather than having to be reachable by the control node at all times.

79-Suppose you've written a task that installs a package using the apt module, but it fails when you run the playbook on a CentOS server. What's wrong, and how would you fix it?

>>The apt module is specific to Debian-based systems, so it will fail on a CentOS server which is based on Red Hat and uses yum or dnf. You could either use the package module which is generic,
or add a condition to your task to use apt or yum depending on the system.

80-Can you describe a scenario where it might be helpful to define your own custom module in Ansible, rather than using the pre-existing ones?

>>Custom modules can be useful when there's no existing module that performs the function you need, or when existing modules don't provide enough control or flexibility. 
For example, you might write a custom module to interact with an internal or proprietary API in your organization.

81-How would you handle a situation where you needed to deploy an application that consists of multiple microservices with Ansible?

>>For deploying an application with multiple microservices, you can use Ansible roles. Each role encapsulates a specific functionality or microservice, and then in your main playbook, you can call each role.
This makes the deployment more manageable and modular.

82-In what scenario would you choose to use a static inventory over a dynamic one in Ansible?

>>If your infrastructure is relatively stable and doesn't change frequently, a static inventory can be simpler and easier to manage. A dynamic inventory is more useful when you're working with 
cloud-based infrastructure that can change frequently.

83-How can Ansible be used to automate system updates and patches?

>>You can write an Ansible playbook that uses the yum or apt module to update packages on your servers. This playbook could be run manually when needed, or scheduled to run 
regularly using cron or another job scheduler.

84-Can you describe a scenario where you would need to use loops in an Ansible playbook?

>>Loops in Ansible can be used to perform the same action on multiple items. For example, you might use a loop to install a list of packages, create multiple users, or make multiple configuration changes.

85-Suppose you want to create a symlink on a group of servers. How can you achieve this using an ad-hoc command?

>>To create a symlink, you can use the file module in an ad-hoc command with state=link. For example: ansible webservers -m file -a "src=/path/to/file dest=/path/to/symlink state=link" -b.

86-How would you use an ad-hoc command to check the uptime of all servers in your inventory?

>>You can use the command module to execute the uptime command on all servers. The command would be: ansible all -m command -a "uptime".

87- Suppose you're managing a web server with Ansible, and you want to ensure that the server is restarted whenever its configuration file is changed. How would you accomplish this?

>>You could use a handler for this. The task that updates the configuration file would have a notify directive that triggers the handler, and the handler would contain the task to restart the server.

88-How would you handle different system environments (development, staging, production) with Ansible?

>>Ansible provides a few ways to handle this. One way is to have a separate inventory file for each environment. Another way is to use group variables to define environment-specific settings.

89-How would you configure a task to run only when a certain condition is met?

>>Ansible uses conditional statements with the when keyword to control whether a task should run. For example, a task might only run when a certain variable is set, or on certain types of machines.

90-How can you distribute the execution of a time-consuming task across multiple systems to decrease the overall execution time?

>>Ansible’s default behavior is to execute operations in parallel up to a certain level of concurrency. You can control this level of concurrency with the forks configuration setting or command-line option.

91-You're managing a set of servers that have slightly different requirements. How might you handle this within a single Ansible role?

>>You could use variables and conditionals to add flexibility to your role. For example, you could have a variable for the required packages, and define this variable differently for each group of servers.

92-Suppose you want to execute a shell script on a remote server using Ansible. How would you do that?

>>You can use Ansible's script module to copy a script from your local machine to the remote server and execute it. Alternatively, you could use the command or shell module to run a script that 
already exists on the remote server.

93-What strategies can you use to optimize the performance of an Ansible playbook?

>>There are several strategies to optimize Ansible performance such as:
•	Limiting the hosts (using the --limit option or specifying a more specific host pattern).
•	Using 'async' for tasks that can run in the background.
•	Disabling facts gathering with gather_facts: no if it's not needed.
•	Using pipelining = True in the Ansible configuration file.
•	Reducing the forks number to limit parallelism if memory usage is a concern.

94-Suppose you need to apply a complex change to your infrastructure that can't be accomplished with a single Ansible module. How might you handle this?

>>This could be accomplished by creating a custom module or using the command or shell modules to run arbitrary commands. In some cases, you might also use a series of existing modules to accomplish
the change in multiple steps.

95-Suppose you are required to manage the network devices along with servers in your organization. Can Ansible be used for network automation?

>>Yes, Ansible can be used for network automation as well. It has specific network modules to manage network devices from various vendors. We can use these modules to automate the configuration and 
management of network devices.

96-How can you deploy an application to an auto-scaling infrastructure with Ansible?

>>Auto-scaling environments can be handled using dynamic inventories. This allows Ansible to query your infrastructure every time it runs, so it always knows about all the servers. 
You can also use Ansible to configure the base image or launch configurations used by your auto-scaling group, ensuring all new servers are configured correctly.

97-How can you test an Ansible playbook to make sure it works before applying it to the production?

>>Testing Ansible playbook can be done by creating a separate testing or staging environment similar to the production environment. Moreover, Ansible has a 'check' mode (--check) which does a dry run and 
shows what changes will be made without actually executing them.

98-Explain how you would use dynamic inventory in a cloud environment like AWS or Azure. What are the benefits and what are the potential drawbacks?

>>Dynamic inventory is exceptionally useful in cloud environments where the inventory can change often. You can use a dynamic inventory script provided by Ansible or a third-party script to connect to 
the cloud provider's API and get a list of instances based on their state, tags, etc. The main benefit is up-to-date inventory; the drawback could be the additional time to get the inventory and the
requirement for valid API credentials during playbook execution.

99-How would you use Ansible to ensure that a certain security policy is applied across all servers in an organization?

>>You can define the security policy as a series of tasks or roles (such as installing certain packages, ensuring certain services are running, or applying specific firewall rules), and then apply those 
roles to all hosts in your inventory. You could also set up a scheduled job to regularly apply the playbook and ensure continued compliance.

100-If you are required to handle a hybrid environment with Linux and Windows servers, how would you structure your Ansible roles and playbooks?

>>You can use conditionals based on the ansible_os_family variable to handle tasks differently based on the OS type. Alternatively, you can separate out tasks into different roles based on the OS,
or even use separate playbooks for Windows and Linux hosts.

101- What strategy would you use to deploy a multi-tier application where the different tiers (like the database, application server, and load balancer) have to be deployed in a certain order?

>>This can be achieved by structuring your playbook into multiple plays, each targeting a specific tier. Ansible runs plays in the order they're defined, so the order of deployment can be controlled 
in that way.

102-How would you handle a scenario where an Ansible playbook needs to interact with APIs?

>>Ansible has the uri module which can be used to interact with a REST API. You can use it to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or HEAD requests.

103-How would you use Ansible in a CI/CD pipeline?

>>Ansible can be used to automate deployment as part of a CI/CD pipeline. After the build stage, you could trigger an Ansible playbook to deploy the built application. If you're using Jenkins, for example, 
you could use the ansible-playbook command directly in your Jenkins pipeline script, or use the Ansible plugin for Jenkins.

104-You're tasked with managing a legacy application with Ansible. This application has a specific package that must be compiled from source with custom flags. How would you handle this with Ansible?

>>You can use the command or shell module to run the necessary commands to compile the package. Remember to use creates or a similar method to achieve idempotency.

105-You are deploying a critical application using Ansible. How would you design a strategy for zero-downtime deployments?

>>Zero downtime deployment can be achieved using a rolling update strategy, where you update a few hosts at a time, ensuring that the majority of your infrastructure remains available. 
This can be done using the serial keyword in Ansible.

106-If you need to execute a task that takes a long time to complete, how would you manage that task in Ansible to prevent it from timing out?

>>You can use the async and poll parameters with a task in Ansible to manage long-running tasks. async launches the task asynchronously, and poll checks back on the task status at a specified interval.
>>The first step would be to time the fact gathering process by setting gather_facts: yes and then running the playbook. Next, disable fact gathering by setting gather_facts: no and rerun the playbook. 
If there is a significant difference in execution time, then the problem likely lies with fact gathering. Optimization can be done by gathering only necessary facts, disabling fact gathering, or caching facts
to avoid gathering facts for each playbook run.

107-How would you handle a large inventory with thousands of hosts in Ansible?

>>You can use inventory scripts to pull inventory from a data source like a CMDB, cloud inventory, etc. In the Ansible configuration, you can also increase the forks to execute more parallel tasks.
Also, breaking the hosts into smaller, logical groups in the inventory can help manage it better.

108-Suppose you need to deploy a package on all your servers, but you want to do it one server at a time to minimize impact on your service. How would you configure the playbook?

>>You can use the serial keyword to limit the number of hosts that are managed at the same time.
---
-	name: Serial execution playbook 
  hosts: all
  serial: 1 
  tasks:
  -	name: Install a package 
    apt:
      name: some-package 
      state: present

109-How would you use a playbook to add a user to your servers and set up their SSH keys?

>>You can use the user and authorized_key modules to accomplish this.

---
-	name: Add user and setup SSH keys 
  hosts: all
  become: yes 
  tasks:
  -	name: Add the user 
    user:
      name: myuser 
      state: present
  -	name: Setup SSH keys 
    authorized_key: 
    user: myuser
     key: "{{ lookup('file', '/path/to/public_key') }}"

      register: found_files

    - name: Display Found Files
      debug:
        var: found_files.files

114-How would you use the find module to find symbolic links within a directory

---
- name: Find Symbolic Links
  hosts: your_target_host
  gather_facts: no  # Disable gathering facts to speed up the playbook

  tasks:
    - name: Find Symbolic Links

123-You need to deploy a web application that requires environment variables to be set. How would you use a playbook to set these environment variables for the application?

---
-	name: Deploy web application 
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes 
  tasks:
  -	name: Run web application with environment variables 
    command: /path/to/web_application
    environment:
      DB_HOST: db.example.com 
      DB_USER: dbuser 
      DB_PASS: dbpass

124-How would you handle sensitive data, like passwords, in your Ansible playbooks?

>>You can use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data. You can then reference the encrypted data in your playbooks.
---
-	name: Playbook with sensitive data 
  hosts: all
  become: yes 
  vars:
    db_password: "{{ vault_db_password }}" 
  tasks:
  -	name: Create database user 
    mysql_user:
     name: dbuser
   password: "{{ db_password }}" 
     priv: '*.*:ALL'
     state: present

In this playbook, vault_db_password is an encrypted variable stored in a separate file and decrypted at runtime.

125-You have a web application that needs to retrieve data from a remote API. How could you use Ansible to securely store the API key needed by the application?

# secrets.yml

126-How would you test an Ansible playbook before running it on production servers?

>> You could use the --check and --diff flags to do a dry run of the playbook and see what changes it would make:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check --diff
Additionally, you could use a testing tool like Molecule to create a local test environment and run your playbook against that.

127-You need to execute a command that takes a long time to complete. How would you use Ansible to execute this command without waiting for it to finish

---
- name: Run Long-Running Command
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  become: yes  # Run tasks with sudo privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Start Long-Running Command
      command: /path/to/your/long_running_script.sh
      async: 3600  # Set the timeout for the async task (in seconds)
      poll: 0      # Set poll to 0 to start the task and immediately move to the next task
      register: long_running_command_result
    - name: Check Long-Running Task Status
  async_status:
    jid: "{{ long_running_command_result.ansible_job_id }}"
  register: job_result
  until: job_result.finished
  retries: 3600  # Number of retries (adjust as needed)
  delay: 10      # Delay between retries (in seconds)
 
128-How would you set up a playbook to ensure that all your servers have the same sshd_config file, and that the SSH service is restarted if the file changes

>># sshd_config.j2

      template:
        src: /path/to/sshd_config.j2  # Path to your template file
        dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      notify: Restart SSH Service

    - name: Check SSHD Config Changes
      command: diff -q /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.old
      register: sshd_config_diff
      changed_when: sshd_config_diff.rc != 0
      ignore_errors: yes
      when: sshd_config_diff.rc is defined

  handlers:
    - name: Restart SSH Service

        name: sshd
        state: restarted

#this is fro safety to backup sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.old

129-Your playbook execution fails midway with a 'Permission Denied' error while trying to copy a file to a remote machine. How would you investigate and solve this problem?

>>This issue may occur due to inadequate permissions. To solve this, you can:
–	Ensure that the playbook is running with necessary privileges. If you're copying a file to a directory that requires elevated permissions, you might need to use become: yes to elevate privileges for that task.
–	Check if the SSH user has the required permissions on the remote machine.
–	If using SSH keys for authentication, ensure the key has been properly added to the remote machine.

130-A task in your playbook is idempotent but still results in a change every time you run the playbook. How would you identify the issue and what could be the possible reasons?

>>The task could be working with dynamic data that changes with each run, or there might be an issue with the task itself. Here are a few ways to debug:
–	Add the -v flag (verbose mode) when running the playbook to get more information about what the task is doing.
–	If the task is using a module, check the documentation for that module to see if there are any known issues with idempotency.
–	Use the debug module to print out the values of variables and other information that might help identify the issue.

131-While running an Ansible playbook, you encounter an error that states "Failed to connect to the host via ssh." How would you troubleshoot this?

>>The error indicates that Ansible is unable to establish an SSH connection to the host. Here's how you can troubleshoot:
–	Confirm that you can manually SSH into the server from the control node.
–	Check that your inventory file is correct (i.e., it has the correct usernames, hostnames/IP addresses).
–	Ensure that the correct SSH keys are being used, and that the necessary keys are added to the ssh-agent if you're using one.
–	If the target is a remote network, ensure there are no firewall rules or network issues preventing the connection.

132-A playbook is running slower than expected. What steps can you take to identify the cause and remedy the situation?

>>Several things could cause a playbook to run slowly. Here's how you might troubleshoot:
–	Use the ANSIBLE_DEBUG environment variable to enable debug mode and identify any tasks that are taking a long time to execute.
–	Use the profile_tasks callback plugin to get a detailed breakdown of how long each task takes.
–	Check network latency between the control node and the hosts. High latency can slow down playbook execution, especially if many tasks are being performed.
–	If many tasks are being performed on a large number of hosts, consider using strategies like free or mitogen for task execution to speed up the playbook.

133-You're trying to use a module in your playbook, but Ansible can't seem to find it. What steps would you take to troubleshoot this issue?

>>This could be due to a few reasons:
–	The module might not be available in the version of Ansible you're running. Check the module documentation to confirm which versions of Ansible support it.
–	If it's a custom module, make sure it's located in a directory specified in the ANSIBLE_LIBRARY environment variable, or in the /library directory adjacent to your playbook.
–	Make sure the module name in the playbook doesn't contain any typos or errors.
–	If the module requires Python libraries that are not installed, it may not be found. Check the module's documentation for any dependencies.

134-Your playbook fails with an error saying that a Jinja2 variable is undefined. How would you resolve this issue?

>>An "undefined variable" error typically means that Ansible can't find a variable that you're referencing in your playbook. Here's how you might troubleshoot:
–	Check for typos in the variable name in your playbook and in any variable files.
–	Make sure the variable is defined for the correct hosts or groups. For example, if the variable is defined in a host_vars file for a particular host, it won't be available for other hosts.
–	If the variable is defined in a role, make sure the role is included in your playbook.

135-A particular task in your playbook is failing, but you're not sure why. How can you get more information about what's happening during the task execution?

>>If a task is failing and the output isn't clear, you can use the -vvv (or - vvvv for even more verbosity) option when running the playbook to get more detailed output:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -vvv
This will show the exact commands that Ansible is running, along with the output from those commands. If you're using modules, 
you might also find the ansible_module_stderr and ansible_module_stdout variables in the task results helpful.

136-Despite no changes in your playbook or environment, a playbook that used to work is now failing. What could be the reason and how would you troubleshoot this?

>>Here's how you might troubleshoot:
–	Check if there have been any changes on the hosts that the playbook is running against. This could include software updates, configuration changes, or network changes.
–	If your playbook depends on external resources (like APIs, remote files, etc.), check if there have been any changes or outages with these resources.
–	If you're using roles or modules from Ansible Galaxy, check if there have been any updates or changes that might affect your playbook.
–	Try running the playbook with the -vvv option to get more detailed output which might help identify the issue.

137-Your playbook uses a role from Ansible Galaxy, but when you try to run it, Ansible can't seem to find the role. What might be the problem and how would you fix it?

>>If Ansible can't find a role, it might be due to a few reasons:
–	The role hasn't been downloaded. You can use the ansible-galaxy command to download the role:
ansible-galaxy install username.rolename
The role is not in a directory that Ansible is checking. By default, Ansible looks in roles/ and /etc/ansible/roles. You can add other directories by updating the roles_path option in the 
Ansible configuration file, or by setting the ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH environment variable.
There's a typo or mistake in the role name in the playbook. Make sure the role name matches exactly with the name of the role on Ansible Galaxy.

138-Imagine you are given a playbook which uses a large number of variables, but it seems like some variables are not being set correctly leading to errors. What steps would you take to debug this issue?

>>You might start by using the debug module in the playbook to print out the value of variables at various points to see what they are set to. You could also check all places where a variable could be set
to see if there are any typos or oversights. This would include the playbook itself, the inventory file, any group_vars/ or host_vars/ directories, and any role defaults or vars files. 
Finally, you can also run the playbook with the -vvv option to get more detailed output, which might help identify any issues with variables.

139-Can you explain how you might use a variable in a task loop and provide an example?

•	Answer: A variable can be used in a loop in Ansible to perform a task multiple times, altering the task slightly each time. The loop keyword is used to define the loop, and variables are used to provide the values to loop over.

---
-	hosts: all vars:
  packages:
  -	nginx
  -	postgresql 
  tasks:
  - name: Install multiple packages 
    apt:
     name: "{{ item }}" state: present
     loop: "{{ packages }}“

In this playbook, the packages variable is a list of packages to install. The loop iterates over each item in the list, installing the package on each iteration.

140-What is the precedence of variables in Ansible when the same variable is defined in multiple places?

>>Ansible has a specific order of precedence for variables defined in different places. The order from lowest to highest precedence is:
–	variables defined in inventory file or passed via command line
–	facts discovered about a system
–	variables loaded from files specified in vars_files
–	variables defined in playbooks
–	variables defined in host_vars/group_vars
–	variables passed to an include statement
–	role defaults

141-How can you use a variable in the name field of a task in Ansible?

>>You can include a variable in the name field of a task by using the Jinja2 templating syntax.
---
-	hosts: all vars:
  task_name: "my custom task" 
  tasks:
  -	name: "Running {{ task_name }}" 
    command: echo "Hello, world!"

In this example, the variable task_name is included in the task name, so the output when running the playbook will be "Running my custom task".

142-Suppose you're in a situation where Ansible is not able to connect to a host and you're unsure whether the problem is in the SSH connection or Ansible itself. How could you leverage Ansible facts
to debug this situation?

>>To test if Ansible can connect to a host, we can use a simple Ansible command that uses the setup module to gather facts. For instance:
ansible -m setup hostname
If this command returns facts about the host, then Ansible can connect. If not, it may return an error message that can help you understand why the connection failed, such as an SSH connection error.

143-Can you provide an example where you would use the 'listen' directive in a handler?

>>One case for using the 'listen' directive is when multiple tasks may cause the same change, necessitating the same handler action. For instance, suppose there are two tasks in a playbook 
that can both modify a web server's configuration file. Both tasks could "notify" a common term that the handler "listens" for, leading the handler to restart the service.

tasks:
-	name: task one
command: echo "This is task one" notify: "Restart Services"
-	name: task two
command: echo "This is task two" notify: "Restart Services"
handlers:
-	name: Restart nginx service:
name: nginx state: restarted
listen: "Restart Services"
-	name: Restart apache service:
name: apache2 state: restarted
listen: "Restart Services"
 
144-How would you test handlers in a large and complex playbook?

>>To test handlers, you could run the playbook in check mode with the '-- check' flag to see if the tasks report changes as expected. Additionally, you could use a testing framework like Molecule,
which allows for more complex testing scenarios, including assertions about the desired state after the playbook runs.
•	ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check

145-What is the purpose of the 'register' directive in Ansible?

>>The 'register' directive in Ansible is used to capture the output of a task. The registered value can be a simple string message, JSON, or other data returned by a task.
It can be used in subsequent tasks for conditional execution, error handling, or debugging.
•	Example:

-	shell: /usr/bin/make_database.sh register: result

-	debug: var: result

146-What is the standard directory structure of an Ansible role?

>>The standard directory structure of an Ansible role includes directories for tasks, handlers, files, templates, variables, defaults, and meta information:

rolename/
├── defaults
│ └── main.yml
├── files
├── handlers
│ └── main.yml
├── meta
│ └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│ └── main.yml
├── templates
├── tests
│ ├── inventory
│ └── test.yml
└── vars
└── main.yml

147-Explain what a Magic Variable in Ansible is and provide an example of its usage.

>>Magic Variables in Ansible are special variables that contain information about the current state of execution, like the current host's name or the current host's group names.
---
-	hosts: all tasks:
-	name: Print current host's name debug:
msg: "This playbook is running on {{ ansible_hostname }}“
In this playbook, ansible_hostname is a magic variable that holds the current host's name.

148- You've been asked to write a playbook that must behave differently based on the host's environment (prod, dev, staging). How would you use Ansible's magic variables to determine the host's 
environment and run conditionally based on it?

>>You can use the group_names magic variable, which is a list of all the groups the current host is a part of. This can be used to conditionally run tasks based on the environment.
---
-	hosts: all tasks:
-	name: Execute only on prod servers command: /usr/bin/prod_script when: "'prod' in group_names"

-	name: Execute only on dev servers command: /usr/bin/dev_script when: "'dev' in group_names“
In this playbook, the first task will only run on hosts that are part of the 'prod' group, and the second task will only run on hosts that are part of the 'dev' group.

149-What is an Ansible collection and how does it differ from a role?

>>An Ansible collection is a packaging format for distributing Ansible content. It can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. While a role is a way to bundle automation tasks, 
a collection provides a way to bundle roles and other Ansible content together. It allows for easier sharing and distribution of this content.

150-How do you install a collection from Ansible Galaxy?

>>You can use the ansible-galaxy collection install command to install a collection from Ansible Galaxy. For instance, to install the community.general collection, you would run:
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

151-How do you create an Ansible collection?

>>You can use the ansible-galaxy collection init command to create a new collection. This command takes the name of the collection in the format namespace.collection. Here's an example:
ansible-galaxy collection init mynamespace.mycollection

This will create a new directory mynamespace/mycollection with the structure for the collection.

152-How do you distribute a collection?

>>You can distribute a collection by building it with the ansible- galaxy collection build command and then publishing it to Ansible Galaxy with the ansible-galaxy collection publish command. 
Here's an example:
ansible-galaxy collection build mynamespace/mycollection
ansible-galaxy collection publish mynamespace-mycollection- 1.0.0.tar.gz

153-How can you optimize Ansible playbooks by using block and rescue keywords for error handling?

>>The block and rescue keywords allow you to group multiple tasks together and handle errors gracefully. By using error handling, you can prevent playbook failures due to transient issues
and continue with subsequent tasks. Here's an example:
---
-	hosts: webservers tasks:
-	name: Set file permissions block:
-	name: Change ownership file:
path: /path/to/file owner: myuser group: mygroup
-	name: Set permissions file:
path: /path/to/file mode: 0644
rescue:

-	name: Handle error debug:
msg: "Failed to set file permissions“

154-How can you create a custom module plugin in Ansible?

>>To create a custom module plugin, you need to create a Python module that follows Ansible's module development guidelines. Here's an example:
–	Create a directory named library within your playbook or role directory.
–	Inside the library directory, create a Python module file with a .py extension, e.g., my_module.py.
–	Implement the necessary functions and logic within the Python module file, following Ansible's module development guidelines.
–	The custom module can then be used in playbooks by referencing its name. Ansible will automatically discover and use the custom module based on the module name specified in the playbook.

155-How can you configure Ansible Tower to integrate with version control systems like Git?

>>Ansible Tower supports integration with version control systems like Git to fetch playbooks and other files directly from the repository. To configure Git integration in Ansible Tower, follow these steps:
–	Navigate to the Ansible Tower web interface and go to the "Projects" section.
–	Click on "Add" to create a new project.
–	Provide the necessary details, including the Git repository URL, credentials, and branch to use.
–	Save the project, and Ansible Tower will automatically sync with the Git repository and fetch the playbooks.
–	This enables teams to version control their playbooks and leverage the benefits of collaboration and change tracking.

156-How can you configure Ansible Tower to use dynamic inventories?

>>Dynamic inventories allow Ansible Tower to fetch inventory information from external sources, such as cloud providers or configuration management databases. To configure dynamic inventories in Ansible Tower,
follow these steps:
–	Navigate to the Ansible Tower web interface and go to the "Inventories" section.
–	Click on the inventory you want to configure.
–	Under the "Sources" tab, select "Manage Sources" and configure the source type (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
–	Provide the necessary details, such as credentials and filters, to fetch the dynamic inventory.
